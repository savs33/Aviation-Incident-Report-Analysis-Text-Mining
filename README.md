# Aviation-Incident-Report-Analysis-Text-Mining
we would like to perform text mining on the accident reports to help find answers to the following questions: 
1.	What are the major and most common types of Incidents reflected in the reports? 
2.	What was the most common course of action post the detection of event?
3.	Most accidents occur during which period of the day- Daylight or Night time? What was the environmental condition?
4.	Who are the people to highlight the incident?
5.	Identify which Airport had suffered many events in the past?
6.	Classifying the event in the reports -Accident/Incident/Near miss event/Unsafe events
