National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000 TH: 262-7 MEMORANDUM FOR: Recipients of Aviation Safety Reporting System Data SUBJECT: Data Derived from ASRS Reports The attached material is furnished pursuant to a request for data from the NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS). Recipients of this material are reminded when evaluating these data of the following points. ASRS reports are submitted voluntarily. The existence in the ASRS database of reports concerning a specific topic cannot, therefore, be used to infer the prevalence of that problem within the National Airspace System. Information contained in reports submitted to ASRS may be amplified by further contact with the individual who submitted them, but the information provided by the reporter is not investigated further. Such information represents the perspective of the specific individual who is describing their experience and perception of a safety related event. After preliminary processing, all ASRS reports are de-identified and the identity of the individual who submitted the report is permanently eliminated. All ASRS report processing systems are designed to protect identifying information submitted by reporters; including names, company affiliations, and specific times of incident occurrence. After a report has been de-identified, any verification of information submitted to ASRS would be limited. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its ASRS current contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, specifically disclaim any responsibility for any interpretation which may be made by others of any material or data furnished by NASA in response to queries of the ASRS database and related materials. Linda J. Connell, Director NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System
CAVEAT REGARDING USE OF ASRS DATA Certain caveats apply to the use of ASRS data. All ASRS reports are voluntarily submitted, and thus cannot be considered a measured random sample of the full population of like events. For example, we receive several thousand altitude deviation reports each year. This number may comprise over half of all the altitude deviations that occur, or it may be just a small fraction of total occurrences. Moreover, not all pilots, controllers, mechanics, flight attendants, dispatchers or other participants in the aviation system are equally aware of the ASRS or may be equally willing to report. Thus, the data can reflect reporting biases. These biases, which are not fully known or measurable, may influence ASRS information. A safety problem such as near midair collisions (NMACs) may appear to be more highly concentrated in area "A" than area "B" simply because the airmen who operate in area "A" are more aware of the ASRS program and more inclined to report should an NMAC occur. Any type of subjective, voluntary reporting will have these limitations related to quantitative statistical analysis. One thing that can be Imown from ASRS data is that the number of reports received concerning specific event types represents the lower measure of the true number of such events that are occurring. For example, if ASRS receives 881 reports of track deviations in 2010 (this number is purely hypothetical), then it can be known with some certainty that at least 881 such events have occurred in 2010. With these statistical limitations m mind, we believe that the real power of ASRS data is the qualitative information contained in report narratives. The pilots, controllers, and others who report tell us about aviation safety incidents and situations in detail — explaining what happened, and more importantly, why it happened. Using report narratives effectively requires an extra measure of study, but the knowledge derived is well worth the added effort.

We got a wake turbulence event, recovered and continued. ATC asked our speed. We said 185, but did not report wake turbulence because of busy radios. We landed as preceding aircraft was clearing the runway. On a visual approach we accept separation and wake turbulence responsibility, and I am aware of flying assigned speeds to help their reduced separation. I found that reporting wake turbulence to ATC is required at a RECAT airport. I recommend that three miles be minimum spacing and that ATL should use their south runway more to handle their traffic load. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information.]

We had intercepted the localizer and were maintaining an assigned speed of 170 kts. A 757 had been vectored ahead of us on the approach, and was approximately 5 nm ahead and 400 ft higher than us. We remarked that a larger aircraft ahead and above us presented a significant risk of encountering wake turbulence and that typically ATC would not put us in such a position. We began to feel a few bumps and I disconnected the autopilot. Seconds later, we were rolled suddenly to the left by wake turbulence. I leveled the wings and we requested a sidestep to runway 4L to avoid further turbulence. We landed without further incident on 4L.

We had an Airbus in front of us, not designated as heavy but to me it looked bigger than an A319. The Airbus was cleared for takeoff and we took the runway to line up and wait. Upon rotation of the Airbus we were cleared for takeoff. I asked the Captain if he was ready, then intentionally paused a moment before smoothly advancing the thrust levers. The Airbus in front of us looked to be starting their turn for the EWR2 off 22R/W by the time we started our roll. Approximately 300 AGL the flight controls felt a tad less effective. In the turn to heading 190, we encountered some light turbulence and the Captain said he thought it was wake from the aircraft in front of us. Tower instructed us to contact Departure at this point. A moment later the intensity of the turbulence turned to moderate in our right turn to heading 220 and climb to 2500 ft predeparture clearance. The Captain asked for a different heading and informed ATC we were encountering wake. Tower instructed us to continue on heading 220 and contact Departure. The Captain switched to Departure and informed them we needed a turn because of wake turbulence. We were instructed to turn right and climb. I believe it was a right turn to 360 or 040 and a climb to 6000 ft. Upon making the turn we left the wake. A few moments later the Captain checked on the flight attendant to make sure she and the cabin had no problems. The Flight attendant reported no abnormalities and the flight continued without incident. Night time made it hard for us to visually determine the amount of horizontal and vertical separation from the previous traffic. Narrative: 2 Initial climb after takeoff from runway 22R in EWR. Encountered wake turbulence from aircraft that departed in front of us, an A320 1 believe. FO as PF handled aircraft very well in order to keep it under control, moderate chop and roll moments were encountered. Aircraft never banked more than 5 degrees. I reported wake turbulence to ATC, they told
us to contact Departure. I repeated report of wake turbulence and ATC gave us instruction of "fly present heading". After wake turbulence ceased we reconfigured aircraft for climb and performed after takeoff check. Flight continued without further incident. Threats were a night time departure and busy conditions at EWR leading me to accept takeoff clearance without inquiring about separation. Additional threat was ATC being too busy to wait any longer to issue takeoff clearance, also too busy to not deal with our report initially. I can ask ATC about separation from aircraft we're following instead of just accepting takeoff clearance, allowing them to check their info and also giving us more time for threat to dissipate.

We were given the FMS Bridge Visual Approach which we had earlier briefed. Landing west in the afternoon sun, I decided to try the sun shade over the HUD, and adjusted the brightness up some as I imagined the sun would make it difficult to see. Speeds and crossing restrictions were made VNAV and LNAV were the active pitch and roll modes. We were cleared for the approach and the App button was pushed arming glidepath and FAC (Final Approach Course). I found it interesting that FAC and glidepath didn't become the active modes and since I haven't flown that approach in at least 5 years thought that would become active at the last approach fix. At approximately 4000 ft I turned the autopilot off and we continued to configure the AC for landing. At approximately 1500 ft the FMA changed to VNAV AL T, the throttles came up. We cycled the flight director switches to reset the system and I continued the approach from SAMUL intersection. I began to transition to visual and at this time started to realize that I was having a difficult time seeing the end of the runway and PAPI through the darkened HUD display. I turned the brightness down to help and was able to see the runway. Around the FIOID fix on the approach my FO advised me that I was low and as I started to correct with pitch we began to encounter wake turbulence from the preceding 777 landing on 28L. My FO then advised me that I was slow and I confirmed that through the dimmed HUD and added power, regaining Ref. speed and leveling off until we regained the glide path for a safe landing. Narrative: 2
We were on the last leg of a rare 3-day domestic trip on the 787. Neither the Captain nor myself had flown a domestic trip on the jet since our IOE. We were cleared to fly the FMS Bridge Visual to RW 28R at SFO. The weather was VFR with no issues other than the sun in our eyes as we flew to RW 28R. The Captain had installed the dark visor cover on his HUD so that he could see with the sun in his eyes, remarking that the dark visor made it very difficult to see the symbology on his HUD. I elected to leave the dark visor Off Of my HUD. The Captain disconnected the autopilot for the approach and I was performing PM duties for him. When we were cleared for the approach I set 1800 FT; in the Altitude window, as we had not captured the FAC course yet. We continued configuring as the Captain hand flew the approach. After capturing the FAC I got distracted with configuring and inadvertently left 1800 FT; in the Altitude window, and we got VNAV ALT. I entered 100 FT; in the window, turned the FDs off and on, and attempted to reconnect the Approach mode, but it didn't capture. At that point I gave the Captain FLCH mode and HDG select for guidance, and we continued with the visual approach. I completed the Before Landing Check at approximately 1000 FT and looked back up to see that we were below glide path, noticing the PAPI lights. At the same time we received a single "Glide Slope" aural advisory and SFO Tower called us and asked us to "check our Altimeter Setting". I immediately advised the Captain that we were below path and to level off, which he did. I then noticed that we were 10-15 knots below target speed and advised the Captain, who made an immediate throttle correction. I looked at the FMA and MCP and saw that the Autothrottle (AT) had disconnected, and I reconnected the AT. At this point we were back on speed and the PAPI showed us on glide path, and we continued the approach and landed normally. Synopsis 3787 Captain reported speed and altitude deviations occurred on approach to SFO and encountered wake turbulence from the preceding B777.

We were sequenced behind a [heavy Airbus] that, when pointed out to us, appeared to be at our altitude and at least 3 miles ahead of us. We were at 170 knots, given a final turn to intercept the localizer and cleared for the approach, then swapped to Tower. At 2000 ft, just prior to glideslope intercept, still 170 knots, we experienced significant wake turbulence. The autopilot was engaged, yet the aircraft rolled sharply to the left, about 20-30 [degrees] of bank and then violently to the right, at least 35 [degrees] of bank. The autopilot attempted to recover, however the upset seemed significant enough that I made the decision to disengage the autopilot, and due to our relatively slow speed, increased thrust and held altitude to fly out of the turbulence. Due to the visual conditions, and the fact that we were at glideslope intercept point, we could have continued to land, but we both felt doing so would lead to another wake encounter. Instead we informed Tower that we were going around due to a wake turbulence encounter and requested to be sequenced back in for the approach. I spoke with the FA who informed me that no one had been injured and everyone was fine in the back. Due to the high work load environment, and this reassurance I chose not to make a PA to the passengers. There was more than the required separation behind the [Airbus].

During clean up and acceleration, the slats were slower than normal to retract. We hit wake turbulence from the aircraft in front of us causing a momentary exceedance of the max flap/slat speed while the slats were still retracting. The event lasted 2 or 3 seconds. Normally the slats retract quicker than with this MEL. Company policy is to retract slats and flaps and accelerate to 250 KIAS. There was no caution in the MEL information concerning the risk Of potential overspeed. Also the wake turbulence we encountered added airspeed rapidly assisting in the speed exceeding maximum for configuration. A note of caution in the MEL notes would have been very helpful. Synopsis A320 Captain reported a momentary slat overspeed resulted during clean-up after a wake turbulence encounter. A slat channel MEL, which causes the slats to retract slower, was cited as contributing factor.

We were flying the ILS Runway 25L with the LOC and GS captured by the autopilot, 8 NM out, when suddenly the aircraft started to shake and the autopilot started compensating strong roll movements. Suspecting wake turbulence I decided to disconnect the autopilot, apply power, and climb to get out of the wake. Once out of the turbulence we reported the incident to LAX Tower and flew most of the approach one dot above the GS. The turbulence continued through the whole approach phase almost down to the runway. I can tell that because I tried to recapture the GS about I NM from the runway and I felt a light roll force as I tried to descend to the GS, so I decided to land beyond the 1500 aiming marks.

Pilot flying immediately disconnected the autopilot, set TOGA thrust and pitched aircraft 15-18 degrees nose up while attempting to level the wings with side stick input. As aircraft approached 30 degrees of bank to the left, we began to clear the wake. PM immediately notified ATC that we were maneuvering for a wake turbulence encounter. ATC responded "0k". We leveled at 9300 ft, reestablished automation and continued so as to cross ZOEEE at 7000 ft. PM queried ATC as to what type of aircraft we were following. ATC responded "a 747". They then asked us to slow for spacing. This was the first time we were notified that we were following a heavy. As best I can remember, our noted distance behind the 3747 after the encounter was between 7-10 miles. Winds were light and variable.

Unsure of his intentions, we asked the aircraft, at which point they informed us they would be out of our way by the time we got there. We responded by saying that would not work, and requested they do a 360 degree turn to fall in behind us. They responded by saying "0k, you're in sight." At this point the aircraft began a turn as we expected, however we believe they shot a low approach in the process, but it was difficult see. Once on short final, we saw them again making a climbing left crosswind turn. Our aircraft then crossed the threshold, and encountered wake turbulence just prior to the left main wheel touching the ground. This caused the aircraft to lose lift suddenly, and drift left of the centerline. The FO initiated a go-around. After the go-around we completed required checklists, I notified the flight attendant [and] passengers, and we landed uneventfully.

Issued a traffic advisory, we acknowledged the MD-II in sight, were cleared for a visual approach for 22L behind the MD-II. At that time we were at 3000 feet and on a 170 heading toward TEB. I wanted to square the approach to maximize separation with the heavy, but also wanted the localizer and glideslope to capture. I disconnected the autopilot, selected 2500 feet, so that the glideslope would capture after the localizer had begun to capture. This is what ATC does when giving us a heading that would cause us to go above the GS before LOC capture. They give us 2500 feet to intercept the LOC. I started down to 2500 feet, then ATC instructed us to maintain 3000 feet until south of TEB. I reversed the descent, and began a climb back to 3000 feet. About that time, I also intercepted the LOC. Just south Of TEB, we encountered the wake of the MD-II. It abruptly rolled our aircraft to the right between 30-40 degrees. I applied opposite aileron and rudder, and returned the aircraft to wings level. I also continued to climb to about a dot above the glideslope to reduce the chances of another wake encounter. I called the FA on the intercom to make sure she and the passengers were 0k, and were told the cabin was 0k. I continued the approach, reduced our airspeed to final approach speed, and continued slightly above the glideslope for the remainder of the approach. Landing was smooth and uneventful. At one point outside the FAF we were only about 2-3 miles in trail. Clearly, descending below the MD-II flightpath was not desirable. The winds aloft were slightly right-to-left, but somewhat aligned with our flight paths and didn't move the wakes aside much. We were on our last leg of the trip, somewhat tired although not fatigued, and hadn't quite realized how close we were to the heavy. Suggestions: Clearly, not putting our aircraft in the same place as the preceding aircraft's wake turbulence would be a good idea. Just because ATC usually does something doesn't mean it's always appropriate.

We were given a climb to FL360 by ATC (don't recall if ZDC or ZID Center) following in trail (approximately 9 miles) of another aircraft at FL360. Our optimum altitude was FL360, assigned speed of .75 Mach for spacing and autopilot engaged. At approximately FL355 we encountered wake turbulence which rolled our aircraft left, at which point the autopilot disengaged. The aircraft rolled to approximately 35-40 degrees angle of bank, at which point I was able to manually take control and returned to straight and level flight. We did get the aural "bank angle" call out. I continued the climb to FL 360 without any further incident. We reported the wake turbulence incident to ATC. Although the spacing looked good and winds negligible, perhaps we were too close to the aircraft ahead. I'll pay more attention to the aircraft in my vicinity.

On glide path at about the 50 ft radio altimeter call out the wings started rocking. I attempted to slightly flatten out the descent angle to rise above the turbulence but the oscillation continued for another cycle. At around 20-30 feet and nowhere near stable due to the buffeting I initiated an autopilot-off go-around. We followed ATC instructions and returned to land uneventfully on runway 35R. In my opinion the event occurred due to poor spacing by the DFW approach facility. We had followed this aircraft on the arrival and in fact were kept 1000 ft higher than normal at SILER due to our tight lateral separation. The ATIS had advertised visual approaches with a 1500 ft reported ceiling but were told to expect the ILS by the Controller. As we joined final we were instructed to maintain 170 knots to a five mile final. The next transmission we received informed us that we had a 40 knot overtake on the aircraft in front of us yet there was no amendment to our previous speed assignment by the Controller. Based on that information I put the gear down with landing flaps and asked the FO to query the Controller whether he still wanted that 170 knots given our closure rate. Of course I knew the answer but when the FO finally got the question out the Controller responded by telling us to reduce to final approach speed, which I was already doing. Basically what happened is the Controller treated us like we were a visual instead of an ILS, even though we were IMC until after passing the FAF. We were never informed what type of aircraft we were following. At some point in the radio exchanges subsequent to our go-around the FO was able to glean that the preceding aircraft whose wake we hit was a B757. By the way this was the return leg of an all-nighter, the second consecutive night in a row for me. It would have helped to have known the type aircraft whose heels we were nipping on final approach. The "170 to five mile final" instruction was unrealistic given our separation and the weather. Not exactly how you want to end an all-night duty period.

Descending to the crossing altitude of 8000, with autopilot engaged, the aircraft banked sharply to the right. The autopilot went to CWS (Control Wheel Steering), and lateral guidance was lost. Regained control/composure with autopilot engaged, LNAV/VNAV level at 8000 when another wake encounter banked aircraft left greater than 35 degrees with significant buffeting. Turned autopilot off and lost about 400 ft in the process of recovery. Narrative: 2 On descent to 8000 on the arrival procedure, passing approximately 9500 MSL we experienced a semi-violent right roll due to wake turbulence from aircraft in front of us. The captain maintained aircraft control, but LNAV dropped off and the autopilot reverted to CWS (Control Wheel Steering). At approximately 8500 MSL we experienced another rapid roll to the left and a steep descent. The Captain disengaged the autopilot and corrected the bank (which was approaching 35-40 degrees) and began leveling off. I announced "Altitude" as we passed 7800 MSL. He corrected the descent and began to climb back to 8000 MSL. The minimum altitude observed was 7650 MSL. I notified ATC of the wake turbulence and altitude deviation and requested a vector to exit the turbulence. The Controller immediately gave us a vector away from the preceding aircraft and a descent to 6300 MSL.

The Approach Controller issued a speed restriction and gave us a warning for wake turbulence. Shortly after he gave us a heading to intercept the final approach course, and cleared us for the visual approach. The Controller issued frequency change to Tower, just as we encountered wake turbulence. We discussed the issue and adjusted our glide-path accordingly to avoid another wake turbulence encounter. We completed the before landing checklist items and on the roll-out realized that we did not switch to Tower for our landing clearance. Distraction and lack of effective CRM resulted in missing required ATC communication during a critical phase of flight. The current approved checklist for the aircraft does not mention landing clearance on the "Before Landing" checklist.

This is an area where orographic turbulence is usually encountered, but there was no mistaking being caught in the wake of the A380. It wasn't wake "turbulence", it was a wake "took control of the aircraft" event. Autopilot was on, speed was assigned, I think at 250 knots. We were exactly where we were supposed to at the assigned speed. [We] pitched up, rolled right significantly, leveled and then rolled left. I disconnected the autopilot, pulled up and banked left to get into the clean air, which I pre-determined earlier when advised we were following an A380 due to the earlier slight left wind from about 11 0'clock at 7 knots. There may have been other pitch and roll excursions as I exited into clean air. [We were] completely at the mercy of the A380's wake, until clear. The FO advised approach of the encounter. I also advised him to advise approach that we were offsetting .2 NM, I think, to the left. We quickly set an offset into the flight plan and continued. Approach advised that the A380 was now proceeding to the Runway 24s or "north complex", which further diverged our paths. We asked the passengers if they were 0k and they also asked if we were 0k. Everyone was fine. Nothing came apart or out of its carriage. No damage. During oceanic operations we use SLOP (Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure). I now firmly believe that we must use a SLOP procedure when following a much larger aircraft. Advise ATC that we are SLOPing into the direction of the clean air. Also, it seems INSANE to be at the same arrival altitudes the massive aircraft was just at. We should always use the top most altitude on all arrivals and in this case, request a 1000 or 2000 ft separation on the arrival or a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ARRIVAL and APPROACH. Synopsis CL-350 Captain reported encountering significant wake turbulence on approach to LAX 12 miles in trail of an A380 that resulted in a momentary loss of control of the aircraft.

We were vectored tight to the airport due to severe thunderstorms east of the field. We were also given a vector tight behind a B747, less than 5 miles in trail. I decided to hand fly the approach due to being high and tight to both the airport and B-747. While configuring we started to experience wake turbulence in addition to light turbulence from the weather. While handling the aircraft in the wake turbulence we were closing in on the FAF and I didn't want the flight director to level and not capture the glide slope, so I called for the missed approach altitude to be set. However I did not realize we were still in FLCH, instead of FPA. The auto throttles advanced and the speed rapidly rose. I immediately pitched the aircraft up and overrode the throttles to idle. I oversped the flaps 3 by 1 kt for about 1 second. I then called for a go-around which was executed without TOGA since we were basically at altitude and FLCH was already active. An uneventful approach to landing followed the go-around. On the ground Dispatch and Maintenance were notified, logbook entry made and an inspection was done, with no defects noted. The go around was not put in the Maintenance log because it was a non-TOGA go-around. We should have requested a delay vector to not be so tight on the 8747. Also both the FO and I should have caught that we were in FLCH when I requested the missed approach altitude. Either of these would have prevented the flap limitation exceedance. Narrative: 2

We were on vectors to final for runway 24R from a right base. During the final course intercept, I turned off the autopilot to fly slightly above the wake from the B777 we were following. The sun was just above the horizon making the B777 traffic and runways difficult to see in the LA haze. During the LOC intercept, I hit the B777 wake and I rolled to wings level to recover, this delayed the turn enough for me to overshoot the LOC to the south. After getting back into clear air, I started a harder than normal turn to final to correct for the overshoot. During the turn, the CA assisted my correction as he had traffic on final to the south complex in sight. At some point in the turn we received a momentary TA from the traffic to our south. After getting back on the LOC, the remainder of the approach and landing were uneventful. Narrative: 2 Just prior to JETSA, following a 8777, encountered the wake at 2200 ft.

I immediately returned the aircraft to our assigned altitude. Vigilant monitoring with the expectation of wake turbulence and/or windshear will aid in a faster response time to corrective action. Narrative: 2 During initial climbout after taking off from DFW, we leveled at 10,000 as instructed by ATC. Shortly after that, we noticed the airplane started to gain some altitude, and the FO (PF) quickly corrected it. We believe this was due the effects of wake turbulence. Suggest using autopilot (we were performing a non RNAV departure out of DFW). In my opinion, having autopilot OFF at the moment of the incident helped to correct deviation in a faster way. However, keeping it ON may be beneficial in terms Of extra vigilance for nearby airplanes that may create wake turbulence.

Very suddenly the nose of the plane dropped followed by the right wing shooting straight up. I had my hands on the controls and I disconnected the autopilot and applied the maximum amount of aileron and full power. The airplane however kept rolling. We finally exited the wake at a nose low attitude. I broke off the approach and the FO requested a heading and altitude from CLT tower/approach. We climbed to 4,000 on a 120 heading and received delay vectors until we could sort out the extensive list of EICAS messages. I tried to re-engage the automation but we lost our air data. A short time later the EICAS shortened down to AUTOTHROTTLES FAIL, WINDSHEAR FAIL, STALL PROTECTION FAIL, and ANGLE OF ATTACK LIMIT FAIL. At this point the autopilot worked again but not the auto throttles. We cleaned up the plane and accelerated to 210 KTS. I then called back to the flight attendants to check on the situation in the cabin. Everyone fortunately had their seat belts on and was fine. I made a cabin PA to the passengers, then the FO ran the associated QRH items associated with each of the EICAS messages. The FO entered the new V speeds, reloaded the approach, ran another descent checklist, then we requested vectors back to Runway 23. On the ground we received ADS 2 (Air Data System) FAIL, ADS 3 FAIL messages.

I asked ATC for a heading and altitude for time to complete some checklists for EICAS messages that resulted from the wake turbulence. Once we completed each checklist we were put back into sequence with no more issues. Follow proper wake turbulence avoidance procedures especially when VFR and visual approaches are in use.

Directly ahead of us was a building line Of thunderstorms, which appeared to top FL340. Shortly after the other aircraft passed overhead, we were cleared to climb to FL380. We were approaching the weather quickly, so we opted to begin our climb right away. Just prior to passing FL350, we encountered moderate turbulence from the wake of the other aircraft, lasting about three seconds. We continued the climb to FL380. The fasten seatbelt sign was on and all passengers were seated. The Flight Attendants were beginning service. The A Flight Attendant reported that no passengers or Flight Attendants were injured.

I as the FO was the PF doing the takeoff and departure from LAX. Prior to pushback we briefed, and were demonstrating a flap auto retraction, while climbing out of LAX on the ORCKAI Departure. We were climbing on heading 251 climbing to DOCKR. We were asked by ATC to begin a southern turn. As the PNF and since I was hand flying, the Captain selected the heading and rolled it in the southern direction 15 degrees. I was head down, hand flying the aircraft and following the command bars as instructed by the Captain, so as to get the full benefit Of the flap auto retraction exercise. At that time we experienced moderate bumps that I believe to have been wake turbulence from previously departed 8757. This caused the Captain's iPad mount to come loose and fall. The Captain worked to reinstall the iPad, and find the departure procedure in order to identity the correct heading. At about the time the Captain was able to verify the correct heading, ATC advised us we had turned too far south and gave us a new heading. We complied and had no further issues. The FMS was verified and correct prior to takeoff. We discussed and briefed prior to push back the change in heading at DOCKR was 15 degrees. We speculate that ATC may have asked to begin our turn after the FMS was commanding our new heading of 236. So that when a southerly HDG was selected, we essentially were turning in addition to the correct HDG change. I the FO and PF was hand flying the airplane. I was focused on hand flying directly where the flight directors commanded, NAV had been captured and anticipating our auto flap retraction demonstration. I should have changed several things. First even though the headings were clear on the SID I should have written both initial headings on my paperwork. This is normally my practice with EO procedures and complex departures. I need to do this for all departures. The directions from the Controller were nonspecific. We were told to begin our southerly turn. If we were told to turn to a specific heading or if I would have asked to verify the heading he wanted there would have been no issue. Also in order to reduce my workload in that situation I should have engaged the autopilot as to have reduced my overall workload and widen the situational awareness of my scan. Synopsis

Person : Flight Crew When Detected : In-flight Result.FIight Crew : Took Evasive Action Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Environment Contributing Factors / Situations : Procedure Primary Problem : Ambiguous Narrative: 1 - Non Weather Related Being vectored for the visual into MIA, Tower gave a traffic advisory for a 737 ahead of us. We advised "In sight." Tower then told us to follow that traffic, cleared for the visual to Runway 26R. In a separate radio call, Tower asked if we could keep our speed up because we would be the last aircraft in before switching direction Of the runways. Winds on the ATIS were reported 240 at 4. We said we would maintain speed. ATC also directed the 737 to maintain same speed to the final. The 737 was sidestepped to 26L, and we were on final for 26R, so to his right. We also stayed, in keeping with aeronautical training, above his glide path. However, due to whatever exact wind and atmospheric conditions prevailed at the time, we did nonetheless encounter the wake turbulence of the 737, and the aircraft attitude changed drastically in what [the] Captain and I agreed was severe turbulence. Objects did fly about in the cabin, and we entered a steep descent and a turn. I do not believe that the aircraft was ever actually out of control. Prior to the time of the encounter with severe turbulence, I was already flying by hand, so I did not need to override automation or take over for it upon disconnection. I leveled the wings and arrested the descent. The total time of the event I estimate to have been 1-2 seconds. After that, the approach and landing were normal. We put down the gear and 30 degrees flaps and had a normal descent and soft touchdown. Everything they tell you about wake turbulence is true. Though we were higher than the 737 and to its right, there was at that altitude a very slight tailwind, and that combined with the heat (perhaps causing rising columns of air from the ground) may have pushed the wake into our path. Contributing factors included my trying to keep the speed of the approach higher than I normally would, in keeping with ATC's request, and atmospheric conditions. Suggested amelioration: Keep farther back from the preceding aircraft, and even higher. Perhaps not try to be quite so helpful on the speed request: I'm sure they would still have waited for us to land.

We were assigned the DOTSSI departure, but on upwind ATC said "turn left heading 210". I scrolled in the heading and selected heading for my FO. Once established on the heading my FO called for flaps O. As I was selecting them I noticed an aircraft on our TCAS that was +1200 ahead and to our left. I told my FO use caution for possible wake turbulence. I looked out to see where it was and discovered it was an A380. ATC thought it was a good idea to cross our little Embraer behind a 380's flight path. And, then we got the wake. My FO hand flew it. He did great and we came out the other side. In the meantime ATC said to maintain 4,000 and direct PEVEE. I could barely get my hand to the push to talk button because of the wake, but managed to get out a "Standby". My FO recovered the airplane and then I told ATC what he had done. He didn't much express a care. I called the FAs to make sure all was okay, they were and we pressed on. I'm not an ATC [Controller], but I'm pretty sure that 380s are dangerous to small airplanes. And, I'm pretty sure that 7 miles in trail is the acceptable distance. If I had known that we were going to cross paths with the A380 1 would not have accepted the heading. ATC is going to cause an accident in LAX with those A380s.

We informed ATC of our encounter and they gave us a new clearance to descend to 9,000. They informed us that we were following an aircraft that was 7.8 miles in front of us. I transferred control back to the FO and he flew a shallower descent to stay above the wake. I called back to the flight attendants to make sure everyone was 0k. There were no injuries. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The spacing between us and the aircraft in front of us led to a wake turbulence encounter. We had a quartering tailwind during this leg of the arrival, which made the wake linger in our flight path. Synopsis CRJ-700 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence at 16,000 ft on Arrival into CLT that resulted in a "violent" roll right and left.

Chicago Center cleared [us] "direct PETTY intersection, climb FL 230, resume normal speed." The Captain (pilot flying) began to accelerate the aircraft and continue the climb to FL 230. At 18,000 ft MSL the aircraft rolled approximately 20 degrees right, 20 degrees left, and the autopilot disconnected. The Captain returned the plane to straight and level flight while the First Officer radioed to ATC that they had just experienced severe turbulence. Chicago Center, surprised, said that a B777 had been in that area but was approximately 50 miles east of that location already. The Captain made an announcement to the passengers and the First Officer talked to the flight attendant. The flight attendant said that she had hit the left side of her head on the overhead bin and then the right sight of her head on the overhead bin during the severe turbulence as she was doing her water service. No passengers were standing at the time of the wake turbulence and the seat belt sign was on. The Captain and First Officer advised the flight attendant to return to her seat and remain seated for the remainder of the flight (approximately 20-25 minutes). Upon landing, the flight attendant complained of a headache and the following day the flight attendant visited an urgent care clinic because of her injuries. The First Officer had slight discomfort in his right rib cage due to a previous broken rib many years prior, but both the First Officer and Captain remained uninjured. There was no damage to the aircraft. Poor spacing by ATC from a 8777 aircraft resulting in severe turbulence. ATC cross check altitude and clearing distance from heavy aircraft. Synopsis CRJ-200 First Officer reported a Flight Attendant was injured after they encountered wake turbulence at 14,000 ft possibly from a 8777 50 miles away.

Person : Flight Crew When Detected : In-flight Result.General : None Reported / Taken Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Environment Contributing Factors / Situations : Procedure Primary Problem : Procedure Narrative: 1 - Non Weather Related Having just finished reading an article about a wake turbulence accident, I felt the need to raise a safety concern regarding "Super" aircraft. An accident involving an Airbus 380 and a Bombardier Challenger 604 caused me to rethink our wake turbulence encounter and [I] felt the need for it to be reported. Just as in the accident/incident, we were separated by 1000 ft in approximately 10 to 15 miles separation. The accident scenario was more of a head on flight where ours was crossing the wake of the A380 at approximately a 70 degree angle. The bump we encountered was nothing more than moderate chop for less than one second. Upon initial contact with Havana Center, we were held down below our planned cruise altitude. Later the Controller pointed out an aircraft as they were approximately 80 miles away 1000 ft above us. We were intending to climb above that altitude and the FO and I mentioned to each other that at that distance we certainly had room to climb now. Visual contact was made on the Airbus approximately 2 0'clock and 20 miles away. As we crossed their wake, they were around our 10 0'clock position and 10 miles. Up until that point, winds were very light and the ride was extremely smooth. There was no wake turbulence encounter expected on our part with such a great distance between the two aircraft. I know without a doubt that hundreds of unreported wake turbulence encounters are experienced daily, mostly on departure with a minimum spacing between the aircraft ahead. I strongly feel that the wake produced by the A380 aircraft needs to be explored more and most likely different spacing requirements supplied. It is almost an impossibility with airspace constraints on arrival and departure to have a fixed plan for every scenario. At least during cruise, more spacing is likely necessary. We are all [aware that] the most severe wake turbulence is at slow speed, high lift configurations. I also believe we have all encountered slight wake turbulence encounters crossing the wake from an aircraft above us, but as the Challenger accident shows, loss of aircraft can occur, thus more research is necessary. Synopsis 3737 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence at FL 350 from an A380 10 miles away and 1,000 ft above them.

While on autopilot the aircraft rolled to the left then to the right. I disconnected the autopilot and assumed manual control. The aircraft rolled again left and then right. I called for "ignition continuous" then, I asked the Captain "what we were following?" He questioned ATC, ATC replied "an Arbus A330." The Captain told ATC that we encountered wake turbulence. At that time the Captain and I noticed the separation between the Airbus and our aircraft was less than ten miles. ATC then gave us vectors [and] while on that vector we encountered additional wake turbulence. Once we were out of the wake turbulence, the Captain called the flight attendants to ask if [everyone] was okay, and they said no one was injured. The flight attendants did make an announcement regarding this situation after speaking with the Captain. We continued the approach and landed safely with no further issues.

Just prior to reaching the FAF the aircraft was completely configured, on speed, localizer and GS. As the Captain began to make the SOP FAF calls, I started to key the radio to check in with Tower. He raised his right hand Off of the thrust levers to indicate to me to wait so that we could make the calls then check in with Tower (aviate, navigate then communicate). In that brief moment we caught the wake of the preceding aircraft (not a heavy), the autopilot disengaged while the stick shaker started. I do not believe we were even 10 knots below ref at the time. The Captain canceled the autopilot alarm, added power, and continued the approach. The aircraft was never more than a half a dot off LOC or GS. Synopsis CRJ-200 First Officer reported a momentary stick shaker occurred after encountering wake turbulence on approach to ORD.

We were given a descend via the arrival instruction except to maintain .78 Mach. This was then changed to cross a fix at or below 18000', maintain speed with caution following a heavy. I changed the constraint at the fix to 17000' to ensure the crossing. The whole way [we were] getting into and out of the wake from the heavy in front of us. To ease out of the wake and to comply with altitude, I switched from managed to vertical speed and we crossed just below FL180 as requested. The next fix was 7.2 miles away with a hard altitude of 17000', we encountered more wake with roll and I used the VSI to get out of it again. We were out of the wake. I missed not getting out of vertical speed mode and sending it to manage. I recognized this just before crossing the fix four hundred feet low and started to correct. ATC issued [descend to] 14,000' at the same time. I set 14,000' and continued to descend with no further issue. In dealing with the change in the arrival to go fast & cross at a different altitude, while dealing with the wake of the previous aircraft I was put into the yellow. Hindsight says I should have done the obvious by asking for some relief and to verbalize (I can't remember if I did or not but I definitely will next time) my exiting managed mode and going to vertical speed. Narrative: 2 While descending via the HLYWD 1 arrival we were given a clearance to cross AVATR intersection at or below FL 180, 1,000 feet lower than the lowest altitude constraint for that intersection. ATC cautioned us to possible wake turbulence from a [heavy] ahead. We encountered the wake turbulence multiple times with significant intensity. As we approached DAAAY intersection ATC gave us a friendly reminder that DAAAY has an
altitude restriction of 17,000 feet and cleared us to descend to 14,000 feet. I noticed that we were about 400 feet low for the DAAAY constraint. No loss of separation occurred. While being distracted by the intense wake turbulence, I failed to notice that the First Officer took us out of managed descent by using vertical speed mode to control the descent. Using vertical speed was inappropriate on an RNAV arrival and a better course of action may have been a request for a heading away from the turbulence. Synopsis A321 flight crew reported overshooting a crossing restriction after being distracted by wake turbulence and changes to the ATC clearance.
