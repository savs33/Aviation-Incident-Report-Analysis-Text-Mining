National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000 TH: 262-7 MEMORANDUM FOR: Recipients of Aviation Safety Reporting System Data SUBJECT: Data Derived from ASRS Reports The attached material is furnished pursuant to a request for data from the NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS). Recipients of this material are reminded when evaluating these data of the following points. ASRS reports are submitted voluntarily. The existence in the ASRS database of reports concerning a specific topic cannot, therefore, be used to infer the prevalence of that problem within the National Airspace System. Information contained in reports submitted to ASRS may be amplified by further contact with the individual who submitted them, but the information provided by the reporter is not investigated further. Such information represents the perspective of the specific individual who is describing their experience and perception of a safety related event. After preliminary processing, all ASRS reports are de-identified and the identity of the individual who submitted the report is permanently eliminated. All ASRS report processing systems are designed to protect identifying information submitted by reporters; including names, company affiliations, and specific times of incident occurrence. After a report has been de-identified, any verification of information submitted to ASRS would be limited. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its ASRS current contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, specifically disclaim any responsibility for any interpretation which may be made by others of any material or data furnished by NASA in response to queries of the ASRS database and related materials. Linda J. Connell, Director NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System
CAVEAT REGARDING USE OF ASRS DATA Certain caveats apply to the use of ASRS data. All ASRS reports are voluntarily submitted, and thus cannot be considered a measured random sample of the full population of like events. For example, we receive several thousand altitude deviation reports each year. This number may comprise over half of all the altitude deviations that occur, or it may be just a small fraction of total occurrences. Moreover, not all pilots, controllers, mechanics, flight attendants, dispatchers or other participants in the aviation system are equally aware of the ASRS or may be equally willing to report. Thus, the data can reflect reporting biases. These biases, which are not fully known or measurable, may influence ASRS information. A safety problem such as near midair collisions (NMACs) may appear to be more highly concentrated in area "A" than area "B" simply because the airmen who operate in area "A" are more aware of the ASRS program and more inclined to report should an NMAC occur. Any type of subjective, voluntary reporting will have these limitations related to quantitative statistical analysis. One thing that can be Imown from ASRS data is that the number of reports received concerning specific event types represents the lower measure of the true number of such events that are occurring. For example, if ASRS receives 881 reports of track deviations in 2010 (this number is purely hypothetical), then it can be known with some certainty that at least 881 such events have occurred in 2010. With these statistical limitations m mind, we believe that the real power of ASRS data is the qualitative information contained in report narratives. The pilots, controllers, and others who report tell us about aviation safety incidents and situations in detail — explaining what happened, and more importantly, why it happened. Using report narratives effectively requires an extra measure of study, but the knowledge derived is well worth the added effort.

On takeoff roll, a loud air noise developed in the cockpit, making it difficult to hear any conversation or radio call. I attempted to press down on the left side window latch, and the noise got worse. We cleaned up the aircraft, and attempted to call departure. It was impossible to hear anything on the radio from the noise level. The altitude warning was not audible from the noise level. I reached over and pulled the window lock upwards to the open position. The noise suddenly stopped as the window latch seated into the air leak. I heard the first call from departure asking what our altitude was. We were climbing through 3500 feet. I immediately leveled off, and said we were descending back to 3000 feet. The controller cleared us to 14000 feet, asking us what our assigned altitude on departure was. I said it was 3000 feet, and we missed our level off because of a distraction in the cockpit.

Person : Flight Crew When Detected : In-flight Assessments : Critical Contributing Factors / Situations : Aircraft Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 While rotating for takeoff I noticed the aircraft yawing around 20-30 degrees with no crosswind component. Upon completion of the after takeoff check list the captain and I discussed the odd flight characteristics on rotation. We noticed the yaw trim wasn't centered and corrected it. After adjusting the yaw and roll trim were noticed both were moving past the commanded position. The captain ran the applicable QRH and we proceeded to [our destination]. The flight continued without incident until I disconnected the autopilot for landing. I had a difficult time maintaining roll control due to a pronouncement right rolling tendency with roll and yaw trim centered. I was able to compensate for the abnormal rolling tendency and landed normally. We notified maintenance of the malfunctions and control issues. Narrative: 2 It was the first flight of the day and second day of a three day. VFR morning and the First Officer the PF (Pilot Flying). He had limited time on the airplane but extremely sharp and in tune with the airplane. During a normal takeoff (no wind/x-wind), my First Officer rotated and I notice the nose starting to yaw to the right as if there was a large x-wind. No substantial wind was noted, I looked at all the engine indications and everything looked normal. After clean up I informed him his inclinometer ball wasn't centered and what happened on takeoff? He was as shocked as I was and didn't know why the nose inadvertently drifted. Upon looking at the trim we noticed the yaw indicating half right and the roll 1/4 left. Upon returning the aircraft to a coordinated state the trim indication showed uncommanded movement of both the yaw and roll trim. Upon leveling at cruise to ensure we were seeing the same we disconnected the autopilot and re-trimmed the aircraft and noticed upon selecting the yaw trim the indicators kept moving more than commanded. The trim would creep but did not meet the threshold for the automated "trim" aural warning. This function was tested and worked during my flow. I know the trim was centered on the ground. Being that the trim was not a complete runaway and was controllable in the sense of repeated centering and constant monitoring, we continued to
[our destination]. We reviewed the immediate action items and the QRH but nothing was cut and dry on having more than one trim runaway. The FO (First Officer) and I agreed that if this problem persisted that we would utilize the AP/DISC (Autopilot Disconnect) press and hold memory item and work out a solution from there. I tried to speak with [Maintenance Control] but another aircraft had an Emergency and I was unable to make contact. I advised dispatch via ACARS of our issue and was told to call tech ops on the ground. On approach, the FO disconnected the AP and I quickly observed him placing large amounts of left aileron (8- 9 0'clock position) with current winds showing only a 2 knot crosswind. Upon landing and follow up with tech ops, the aircraft had a small history of recent flight control issues. The FO taking over the aircraft was one of the crews who had previously written the aircraft up for similar issue in regards to the ailerons. Upon meeting up with crew who flew the aircraft and overnighted this aircraft, they too had a similar condition but didn't notice the trim. I've never seen or heard of two trims moving uncommanded at the same time let alone in opposite directions. No QRH procedure exists nor can you account for everything that can and will go wrong. If I had followed the QRH preemptively by isolating both yaw and trim computers I was unsure if it was safer to do so or if by doing so might inadvertently put me in a worse situation. Was it the Trim Panel, wiring issues, a rogue rudder PCIJ (Power Control Unit)? I didn't know, but we did our best to monitor, stabilize and create readiness for a plan B. Synopsis ERJ-190 flight crew reported uncommanded trim movement in both the yaw and roll axis.

Person : Flight Crew When Detected : In-flight Result.FIight Crew : Landed in Emergency Condition Result.FIight Crew : Overcame Equipment Problem Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Aircraft Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 We were operating from ZZZ-ZZZI. Due to delays into ZZZI we pushed back out of the gate at XB:24 local from the original time of XA:07. We had light to moderate snow in ZZZ so after pushback we proceeded to the deice pad to get the aircraft free of contaminants before takeoff. We departed ZZZ at XB:59. The flight started mostly in IMC conditions but by the time we began our descent on the arrival we were in VMC. We were at 10,000 ft and approach was beginning to vector us for the LOC due to strong winds in ZZZI. There were strong winds in ZZZI that evening but it was VMC with visibility of 10 SM. The CA was PF and I was PM. At 10,000 ft while heading to ZZZI, we had the autopilot on and it was coupled to the CA's side. Suddenly the autopilot disconnected. We had no indications other than a Yaw Damper I status message. We reengaged the autopilot, Yaw damper I, and continued with our descent to 6,000 ft. At approximately 6,000 ft, the captain's altitude indicator started showing an increasing roll to the left, the autopilot disconnected again, we got and EFIS COMP MON caution message and the captain's attitude indicator continued its roll to the left until it was completely inverted. Due to the increasing bank angle on the attitude indicator, the captain's screen decluttered and we had an almost continuous "BANK ANGLE" aural warning. While this was happening, my attitude indicator indicated a slight roll to the right and showed an amber ROLL and PIT flag on the lower portion of the attitude Indicator. The captain's airspeed indications also did not match what was on the standby instruments nor did it match my instruments. At this point, the captain had taken manual control after the autopilot disengaged and we both tried to figure out the problem while using the outside horizon to determine our attitude since it was VMC and confirming it with our standby attitude indicator. ATC had cleared us to 4,000 ft and right heading 060. On request from the CA, I reported to the controller that we had an instrumentation error. The controller asked if we needed any assistance and we decided to [advise ATC] since we weren't able to trust our speed, altitude, and attitude indications. The controller asked us if we still wanted to go to ZZZI. Since we were very close to the airport, and in VMC conditions, the CA agreed to proceed to ZZZI. I replied to the controller; "Affirmative" to confirm our intentions to land at ZZZI. Meanwhile, the CA was flying using visual references. Keeping the aircraft level with the horizon. The captain and I continued scanning our instruments and noticed that my attitude indicator started to come back to wings level and that my airspeed, altitude, and attitude all matched the standby instruments. The captain decided that since my side matched the standby that I should take the controls and I did. I continued to fly manually while the captain talked on the radio and assisted me by bugging speeds and altitude. ATC stated that they planned to put us on a right downwind for the visual since the
meteorological conditions permitted it. Once aligned with the extended centerline, we had the runway in sight and got cleared for a visual. At this point, my instruments looked accurate but I was still double checking with the standby instruments and the captain kept double checking my airspeed and altitude to make sure we were stabilized on glide path. Aside from the malfunctioning instruments, we were flying the approach as normal. We landed the aircraft safely and proceeded to the gate as normal. This incident happened very close to the ground, flying during evening hours, in congested airspace. This made the situation a bit more challenging. We were ready for the approach. We had loaded it into the FMS and had briefed it way before we initiated our final descend into ZZZI. However, when faced with the instrumentation failure that we experience, I felt we did not have as much time as we would have liked to try to troubleshoot the problem. We were very close to landing and decided that since the meteorological conditions were favorable, we should just go ahead and land the aircraft. As a crew we would have liked more time to run our QRH procedures, as trained by the company, but at the time this did not seem suitable since we more than likely would have had to be vectored out somewhere away from all the traffic. With night time approaching, as well as weather from the west, we decided that time was critical and landing immediately was the better decision. The aircraft was never in an undesired state. We are both very familiar with this airspace and having the airport in sight when this happened helped us maintain our situational awareness up and maneuver the aircraft to a safe landing. I believe that as a cockpit crew, the CA and I had great communication and good CRM. However, due to the time constraints, we were unable to brief the cabin crew like we wanted. Everything happened very quickly and we never thought it was going to end up badly so we never briefed them. In hindsight, we should have briefly told them what was happening and that we were landing immediately just in case something did happen upon touchdown and they could proceed in the way they were trained. Also, from a human factors point of view, I believe the CRJ does a poor job in telling the pilot that the AHRS system has failed. We are used to receiving caution and warning messages on our EICAS but for this particular system failure all we got was a EFIS COMP MON message. I remember this from ground school but unfortunately, during day to day line flying, when we see an EFIS COMP MON message we normally just associate it with magnetic interference so we are a bit desensitized to it. When we got this message during this incident, we knew it was the AHRS acting up but it takes a lot of crosschecking between instruments to figure out which one is right and which is wrong. I believe that a more efficient system should be develop to let the pilot know exactly what's being affected so the pilot has to work less determining the problem and use his time to troubleshoot. If I ever encounter an event like this again, I think trying to slow things down might help. I will use this as a learning experience and take away the things that worked and leave the ones that didn't so that I can be more prepared to deal with this in the future. Synopsis CRJ-700 First Officer reported several messages and instrument indications associated with a malfunction of the Attitude and Heading Reference System.

Tower reported previous aircraft reported a plus 20 knot increase on final. Fully configured, inside of ZZZZZ [Waypoint] approximately 1200 feet, encountered a plus 40 knot increase in airspeed with an ascent. I executed a go-around. No predicative wind shear indications. It seemed like immediately on the go-around we encountered severe turbulence. I directed the First Officer to tell ATC we needed an immediate right turn. Thunderstorms were painting about 10 miles north of the field at the time Of the approach and I suspected that was the cause. ATC gave us a heading but I did not think it was enough. Keep in mind this was all happening very fast. I wanted a 180 degree turn away from the storms.... All this while in severe turbulence. The jet was shaking so violently I could not read the airspeed, altitude or heading. I could see the red and amber in the airspeed indicator and the blue on the HSI. Again, this was all occurring simultaneously; the autopilot kicked off. I had a handful of airplane and could not read the instruments. I tried to reengage the autopilot 2 or 3 times but it continued to kick Off. The airspeed during all of this, as best I could tell, seemed to go from the red to the amber, over speed to low speed and back rapidly. Also had rapid, uncommanded, pitch and roll. I don't really know how long it lasted but I would guess 2 or 3 minutes. After we were out of the turbulence and had the jet under control ATC vectored us back around for another approach. I asked if other airplanes got in after us. Not sure if I asked the First Officer or ATC. I was trying to clear my mind after what just happened but I don't think I was successful. I was thinking get this thing on the ground. Somewhere on final encountered the moderate to severe turbulence again and broke out to the right and started heading south again. Made the decision to divert.... I had over 12,000 lbs. of fuel so was not concerned about that.... No time to consult with dispatch, but did call enroute. Landed uneventfully. As we were being vectored for the approach the runway and airport was in the clear. I could see it all just fine. We were painting the storms north of the field but the other aircraft ahead of us were getting in. With the exception of the report of a 20 knot gain by the previous jet there were no indications of a real threat. It all happened suddenly and for the most part unexpectedly. I was aware of the potential for wind shear and was thinking
about the possibility. I called dispatch prior to leaving to ask about the weather and was told it should pass [destination] to the north. The alternate was a "just in case." I'm still not sure what we encountered. Was it a microburst? Blow off from the storms just north of the field? I don't know. Narrative: 2 At approximately 600 feet AGL, the airspeed began to increase, consistent with a strong gust. As the airspeed continued to increase approximately 40 knots above planned VREF, the Captain initiated a go-around. Turbulence was encountered in the climb as we configured the aircraft, and gradually worsened as we climbed and proceeded over the field and northeast of the field. With the proximity of the storm cells north of the field, we requested a vector to the right away from the weather. At that time, the line was still north, extending northeast, so ATC gave us a 020 heading. During this time, the turbulence had increased to severe, and it was difficult to see the instruments or manipulate the FCU, and the Captain attempted to utilize the autopilot but it kicked offline. We asked for and received a vector further right to 040, and when it was apparent this was not enough, we told ATC that a vector directly away from the line was required. ATC provided a 090 vector, and at this time, while at 5,000 feet we were in and out of the bottom of the clouds, still experiencing severe turbulence. ATC gave us a vector to 170 and the turbulence died down and the ride south of the field was smooth. Aircraft were still being vectored to final, and I considered that the airspeed increase may have been due to a gust front. Synopsis A321 flight crew reported encountering windshear on approach with no predictive windshear indication and then severe turbulence on the go-around with thunderstorms in the vicinity.

Result.GeneraI : Maintenance Action Result.Aircraft : Aircraft Damaged Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Contributing Factors / Situations : Contributing Factors / Situations : Contributing Factors / Situations : Primary Problem : Ambiguous Narrative: 1 Aircraft Human Factors Manuals Procedure Few minutes before the scheduled departure time we contacted the Ramp Control for pushback instructions and we were told to push back. The ground crew complied with the instructions and pushed the airplane back. The ground crew disconnected the aircraft. Engine 1 and the APU were running; Engine 2 was off. The hydraulic pump switches were all in the 12 0'clock position. After the ground equipment was removed and clear of the aircraft the Ramp Controller instructed us to taxi straight ahead and make a right turn to and to monitor the next controller. I applied power to Engine 1, quickly followed by pressing down on the tiller, but I immediately felt that I did not have steering control and as the airplane gained momentum it started to turn right due to pure asymmetrical thrust. This is the second time that I experienced a steering failure on initial taxi out. I noticed the STEER OFF message on the EICAS even though I was firmly attempting to engage the steering. I reduced thrust to idle and brought the airplane to a stop. I switched the electric hydraulic pumps I and 2 to ON (even though Engine I was running) and tried to engage the steering one more time. This time I got an advisory (blue) STEER FAIL message on the EICAS. I reconfigured the hydraulic pumps to their normal position (AUTO). I also recycled the parking brake, and tried to engage the steering again, unsuccessfully. At this point the airplane was facing due west and blocking about half of the entrance of the [taxiway]. The Ramp Controller was also questioning our actions, which did not match his instructions. The First Officer explained that we had a steering failure and that we probably needed to go back to the gate. The First Officer and I discussed that it was going to be very challenging to taxi without steering. So I told the Ramp Controller that I was not sure if a return to gate was necessary and that I could just taxi the airplane back to get it out of the way and call maintenance. I then applied power to Engine 2 and carefully proceeded to make a right turn back into the ramp using differential braking. In doing so I felt unusual resistance and difficulty trying to make the airplane go straight. Ramp personnel and [Company] Line Maintenance in the area quickly approached the AC (without anybody calling them) and instructed us to stop immediately (we were already stopped). A [Company] Mechanic plugged his head set and told us that the nose wheel had flipped 180 degrees (we had a LG NO DISPATCH message on the EICAS). After several attempts the ground personnel and maintenance managed to turn the nose wheel to the right position and towed the airplane back to the gate. During this time I contacted the dispatcher and explained the situation. Once at the gate I logged the maintenance discrepancies, and contacted MX Control. We then swapped aircraft and completed the flight with no issues. My perception of Steering Failures on initial taxi out: As I mentioned, this is the second time that this happens to me. I always thought this issue was mainly caused by the ground personnel leaving the Steering Switch accidentally in the DISENG position. It is important to note that the first time I had this issue the
External Power Connection Access Panel was on MEL, and taped over, so the crew could not verify the position of the switch. During that occasion Maintenance personnel approached the aircraft on the ramp and had us go through a "button pushing" sequence to reset the system. I was under the impression that they also checked the exterior panel, but I never actually learned what they did and what the root of the problem was. Today, I assumed it was also the outside switch that had been left in the DISENG position. Why I decided to steer the airplane using differential braking: I had a STEER FAIL in flight while on approach to ZZZ on Oct 2017. After landing on Runway XX I steered the airplane onto a high-speed taxiway, stopped and asked for the QRH. The QRH states that the procedure for a steer failure is to steer he airplane using differential braking and rudder. Nothing more. So, I did just that and I was able to taxi the airplane all the way to the gate using this method. Also, during my upgrade PC I was given a steer failure during taxi out and was told to demonstrate taxiing with differential braking and rudder. Therefore, when the steer failed on taxi out on Nov 2017 1 felt fully capable of safely steering the airplane back to the ramp area, and away from an active taxiway using differential braking. What I have realized: On Nov 2017 1 was single engine. While common sense says that it is not a good idea to try to steer using differential braking while on single engine I have never been explicitly instructed not to do so, or that the airplane is not able to withstand it. Doing some reading on the subject I found that the Systems Manual has a note stating that "after a power up, the first steering engagement must be performed with the airplane stopped. If this condition is not met, the hard over test might not be successfully accomplished by the system and STEER FAIL message might be displayed. " I have developed the habit of sometimes letting the airplane advance before engaging the steering. I cannot remember when exactly I started doing this, but I believe I might have done it a few times during CA IOE. I don't remember explicitly being told not to do that. But with this new knowledge I suspect that my two steering failures on initial taxi out might have been caused by me not knowing how to use the system properly. The company should emphasize to new Captains during training the operation, limitations, and different modes of the E-JET steering system. I remember only briefly going over the system during initial training. During upgrade no particular emphasis was placed on this system. [The Company] cannot take it for granted that all First Officers have a solid understanding of a system that they don't have operational experience in. [The Company] should divulge information stating that the E-JET steering system must be engaged before the airplane moves, and that single engine "Free Wheel Steering" is not allowed. Synopsis EMB-175 Captain reported that they were unable to taxi due to loss of steering.

We were passing through 23500 ft when suddenly the aircraft was thrown violently into a left roll, followed immediately by a sudden roll to the right and a jolt. The autopilot continued to function which helped keep the aircraft in a controllable flight. I had the FO call and check on the FA and she told us that she had fallen and hit her head. I made the decision to air return back to ZZZ. At this time the FO took control of the flying duties while I coordinated with ATC, the company and OPs. I also rechecked on the FA, and she stated that she was starting to feel dizzy and light headed. We [advised ATC] and were turned directly towards ZZZ. This all happened within 2-3 minutes of initial occurrence. We returned and landed with no further problems. We were met at the gate by paramedics and the Inflight Supervisor and our FA was escorted to the ambulance. It was decided that she was going to be transported to the hospital for further evaluation. In a situation like this there can be numerous threats. 1st, aircraft upset by turbulence, 2nd, and injured crew member, 3rd communicating with ATC, OPS and then coming up with a quick plan to safely bring the aircraft and passengers back to the airport. As with almost any situation, looking back, there are things to be learned. As a pilot the "I can do it all" attitude has to be put aside and one must use all resources at hand. I learned, again, that crew resource management, i.e. the FOs quick and initial, "I can fly while you make a plan and communicate with everybody" (not quite the quote) helped make this situation more controllable. It would help, however, if there was one person who could be called after landing to coordinate. As it was I had to call dispatch, scheduling, ops, Maintenance, and none seemed to know that I was on the phone with the other. Synopsis EMB-145 Captain reported returning to the departure airport after a Flight Attendant was injured during a wake vortex encounter climbing through FL235 in trail of a B777.

Contributing Factors / Situations : Aircraft Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 At FL250 received a Yaw Damper 2 (YD2) INOP status message. Shortly after, experienced sudden yawing motion. Suspecting the yaw damper, disconnected it, which also disconnected the autopilot. Yawing motion continued, both left and right and short, sudden motion, as well as long, sustained ones. Re-engaged YD2 and the autopilot, with the uncommanded motion diminished. Were then cleared to descend via the arrival when the yaw damper disconnected, resulting in a caution message and an autopilot disconnect. Ran the QRH. Decided to leave the yaw damper off. At the same time the yaw motions started again, the cause being uncommanded rudder movements observed on the flight controls synoptic page. Advised ATC unable to continue the arrival due to no autopilot, and requested step-down instructions. Was unable to determine the cause of these rudder movements, and found no reference in the QRH. As the yawing was not diminishing (it was quite noticeable, requiring constant corrections by the flying First Officer), and the cause was unknown, we decided to land as soon as possible. [Requesting priority handling] with ATC. Advised the cabin of sterile procedures and completed all checklists, but decided to contact Dispatch once on the ground in order to have both pilots monitor the aircraft's behavior. Kept speed and configuration changes slow and gentle, and as the aircraft remained controllable, decided not to brace the cabin. Landing was normal. Once on the ground, while being externally inspected by the emergency trucks, briefed the flight attendants and the passengers. At the gate, contacted Dispatch and Maintenance. Synopsis CRJ-900 Captain reported a yaw damper INOP status message received in cruise, followed by uncommanded rudder movements. Captain requested priority handling to a normal landing.

We were in the descent with the speed brakes deployed and we were about 10 knots under the max foot and stable. Suddenly the yellow foot shot down 20-30 knots followed by the red foot. An overspeed warning alert sounded with a high speed protection annunciation. No weather, turbulence or pitch changes occurred to cause this. Within a few seconds the foot returned to normal about 10 knots above our descent speed and all was well. A few seconds later the yellow and red foot repeated the sudden downward movement and we received the same warnings again. A few seconds later the feet returned to normal and we resumed our descent. At this point we were trying to diagnose the issues and figure out what was wrong and without knowledge to us the aircraft was no longer in prof and went to level change and we descended past our clearance limit of 11,000 to 10,600 before we reversed our descent to a climb back to 11,000. [ATC didn't say] anything and we remained at 11,000 feet until ZZZZZ and continued our clearance to 10,000 after we passed ZZZZZ. I'm not sure what caused the speed/foot/overspeed anomalies. I wrote it up in the logbook and briefed maintenance as a theoretical overspeed from the warnings, but I don't actually believe we had an overspeed, but I can't be sure with the quick changes that appeared and disappeared. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Synopsis MD-II crew reported an anomaly with the overspeed warning alert twice during descent which also caused the profile decent system to miss a level off.

We were flying the ILS Runway 25L with the LOC and GS captured by the autopilot, 8 NM out, when suddenly the aircraft started to shake and the autopilot started compensating strong roll movements. Suspecting wake turbulence I decided to disconnect the autopilot, apply power, and climb to get out of the wake. Once out of the turbulence we reported the incident to LAX Tower and flew most of the approach one dot above the GS. The turbulence continued through the whole approach phase almost down to the runway. I can tell that because I tried to recapture the GS about I NM from the runway and I felt a light roll force as I tried to descend to the GS, so I decided to land beyond the 1500 aiming marks.

Result.Flight Crew : Returned To Departure Airport Result.FIight Crew : Landed As Precaution Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Aircraft Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 On climb out passing through approximately 7,000 FT, we received an "EFIS COMP MON" caution message immediately followed by an AP TRIM IS ND (Autopilot Trim is Nose Down) caution message. I instinctively looked at the elevator trim display and observed the trim running nose down. I immediately pushed the stab trim disconnect and instructed the First Officer to do the same. I assumed control of the aircraft and told the First Officer to request a level off at 10,000 FT from ATC. As he was doing that I disconnected the Autopilot and found it to be excessively out of trim to the point that it was very difficult to control. I instructed him to run the Stab Trim Runaway checklist. Although we never heard the trim clacker, it seemed at the time the more prudent checklist to run. I had the First Officer request a turn back towards [departure airport] as a precaution although we had not committed yet to a return. During this turn I lost some altitude due to the excessive nose down trim as the primary cause but was able to gain it back. Upon further reflection, I decided to run the AP TRIM IS ND checklist because I felt that the Autopilot was the more probable cause. I reengaged the trim and trimmed the aircraft for level flight. We did not experience any trim runaway. After briefing the First Officer about the Autopilot possibly driving the trim nose down, a reengaged the Autopilot per the checklist. Immediately the trim started moving nose down so I once again disconnected the trim and the Autopilot. I reengaged the trim and left the Autopilot off. I determined the Autopilot had malfunctioned and since at this time we had full control of the aircraft, I elected to not [get priority handling]. I had the First Officer request a return to [departure airport] and instructed him to notify the flight attendants and to ACARS dispatch. We returned and landed uneventfully. Synopsis CRJ-700 Captain reported returning to departure airport after experiencing an autopilot malfunction that drove the stabilizer trim to a nose-down position.

We were on the DUNNN2 RNAV Arrival into the Denver's Centennial (APA) airport and were provided with some shortcuts that actually simplified the procedure. The ATC Controller said to "descend and maintain 14,000 FT and be level in 5 minutes." The pilot flying started his clock and had the time/altitude restriction wired using the vertical speed mode of the autopilot. We entered some moderate turbulence at 14,300 FT during the descent and the autopilot disengaged but the pilot flying did not notice. I may not have noticed immediately because I was setting both heading bugs. Normal non-flying pilot duties. If I didn't see the disconnect right away, I'm sure within three to five five seconds I observed the autopilot disconnect annunciator light. I verbalized that the autopilot kicked off and to get the nose down. I saw the slight nose up tendency which was probably due to the stab trim condition and perhaps the effect of the bumpy air. The pilot flying saw the altitude increase and instead of manually flying (like I would have thought a jet pilot would do) and pushing the nose over slightly, he was using/manipulating the autopilot vertical speed wheel to arrest the climb. I was focused on his flight instruments and saw his right hand on the yoke (and trying to determine if we had a runaway trim or flight control malfunction) but didn't realize that his focus was on the darn now non-functioning (and slow to command even if it was working) vertical speed wheel. I said, "l have it" and made a quick recovery but we topped out at almost 15,000 FT with a then expeditious return to our assigned altitude of 14,000 FT. I have stressed good hand flying skills to this aviator and have insisted that he practice honing those skills. He has good hand flying abilities but I'm sure that many aviators are reluctant to disengage and go down on the automation ladder when needed. I don't believe a loss of separation occurred because Denver TRACON gave us a turn just before this autopilot/pitch-up (that was why I was heads down setting both the independent HDG Bugs) occurrence happened. I would not be writing this if it wasn't for the "be level in 5 minutes" clearance. Even with the altitude excursion we didn't miss the timing by much. Could I have done a better job? I'm sure, but I am fighting a culture of pilots that are too dependent on automation. If I [had] been the flying pilot, I have little doubt that ATC or anyone in the back of the airplane would have known of our issue. I would like to think that a near immediate transition to manual flight would have occurred, just like what you would see say on an ILS approach and disconnecting the autopilot on final. We don't disconnect and let the
airplane do what it wants, we fly the darn thing. On a side note, I gave the airplane back to him after leveling and stabilizing and he re-engaged the autopilot. Synopsis CL60 Captain reported he noticed a deviation from assigned altitude when the autopilot disconnected, and observed that automation dependency was a factor in the excursion.

There were no obvious abnormalities, no warning lights or indications. We started to feel the additional yaw excursions. One of us selected the FLT CNTRL page on the EICAS, and we could then see fairly significant movement of the rudder (not extreme excursions, but more than would normally be seen in cruise). I called for the QRH for un-commanded rudder movement. We ran through the steps, including disconnecting the autopilot and yaw dampers. As soon as the YDS (Yaw Dampers) were disconnected the un-commanded movements stopped. As the conditions did NOT persist, we were not required to land at the nearest suitable airport. As the aircraft was controllable we decided it was acceptable to continue on. However, as we were worried that the problem could reoccur I determined the safest course of action was to inform ATC so that if we needed to divert everything would be in place for us. We asked for and received a new clearance for lower and slower, and ATC also gave us direct to [the destination]. We were asked for and provided the usual information (souls on board, fuel, etc) as well as a basic description of the problem. We also contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via ACARS, advising them of the problem, our current condition, and intention to land if nothing further happened, or divert if necessary. Lastly, we advised the Flight Attendants what was happening, that we expected a normal landing and taxi-in, but to be prepared in case the situation worsened and called for a change in plans. We continued the flight, with me flying manually. We asked for and received clearances to allow for relatively gentle descents and turns and a long final so as to keep stresses on the controls light. I performed a normal visual, backed up with the ILS, to the longest runway, followed by a normal touchdown and roll-out. Normal taxi-in and parking, after which I contacted [maintenance operations] via telephone to discuss what had happened and the write-up entry I was doing.
It appeared to me to be just and odd equipment abnormality. We did discuss the local weather (was it a wind shear issue, etc), but all the weather was far west of our position when it was happening, so that was ruled out as a factor. As I stated above, we thought about a wake turbulence issue, but there was no traffic anywhere near us. And as soon as the Yaw Dampeners were disconnected the problem seemed to stop. I will also add that it required considerable right rudder trim to center the brick once I started manually flying. Somewhere in the 30-40% range of the indicated available travel. This might or might not be a symptom of the issue. Synopsis CRJ-900 Captain reported that they disconnected the autopilot and yaw dampeners and flew the aircraft manually due to uncommanded rudder movements.

At the time ORD was landing Runway 28C. Just prior to our takeoff an A321 was landing Runway 28C which crosses over Runway 22L's takeoff roll path. At approximately 120-130 kts our aircraft suddenly and aggressively yawed right. This occurred prior to VI but in the high speed regime. As pilot monitoring I double checked the engine and flight control indications. Everything was normal so I did not make a call out. The Captain (pilot flying) was able to return the aircraft to runway centerline and took off normally without any further issues. The winds during takeoff were reported 300 degrees at 8 kts. I believe that we encountered jet blast or wake from the aircraft landing Runway 28C.

Within what seemed to be approximately a 3-4 second time lapse, this sound became completely unbearable. Communications with ATC as well as communications within the cockpit were extremely difficult, rendering the requirement for maximum volume selections and overhead cockpit speakers on and at maximum volume, to optimize our ability to discern ATC communications. Visual and physical inspections of the First Officer window revealed that the window was properly secured. The window also had an accompanied vibration. The Captain conducted excellent CRM utilization and leadership with all crew members. We determined that a continued
flight would not only be detrimental to safety, but would also, and in short order, render permanent hearing damage to us all. All crew members determined that an immediate level off during our climb was needed, followed by communications with ATC regarding our need to return to [departure airport], as well as the need for us to fuel dump to achieve a safe landing weight for the aircraft. During our eventual descent, we noticed that the extremely loud noise quickly dissipated close to the same altitude it began. All checklists were accomplished. Updated weather information and landing performance was gathered followed by appropriate briefings, to return to our departure airport. A successful landing was ensued with appropriate debriefs with local maintenance personnel whom later shared with us the degradation of the First Officer window seal. Narrative: 2 After takeoff climbing through 8,000 feet the FOs window developed a very loud high pitch squeal and vibration in the window. I ask ATC to hold our altitude that we were working a problem. The higher the cabin altitude climbed the louder the noise, to the point where we were having difficulty communicating. After we accessed our situation I decided to return. Asked radar for a fuel dumping area and we were cleared to dump. We also contacted OPS and got a release for a return, which we received. We ran all of our checklists, terminated the dump and briefed the approach. Once we had everything squared away, we flew the ILS for an uneventful landing. MX found a broken window seal. Reasons to dump fuel and return: I) Noise level becoming unbearable and inhibited communication between crew members and hearing ATC, 2) Concern for a window failure due to vibration, 3) A 9 hrs over water flight. I feel I must recognize the crew for remarkable performance and our use of CRM, made for a safe uneventful return. Narrative: 3 An extremely loud noise and vibration suddenly originated from the FO window during climb at approximately FL80. The FO window was closed and locked with the locking lever in the locked position. ATC communications and crew cockpit communications became extremely difficult as we climbed out on the SID. Several clearances were repeated by ATC and aircrew due to extreme noise. Continued painful noise exposure was deemed intolerable and imprudent by the crew. Climb was stopped and fuel dumped for a normal landing at departure airport. The noise subsided during the descent to an uneventful landing. Synopsis MDII flight crew experienced a loud squeal passing through 8,000 that continued to grow louder, making communication difficult. Crew elected to return to the departure airport after dumping fuel.

We were handed off to Tower and it was immediately evident that the Tower Controller was very busy handling multiple aircraft on approach to both south runways as well as handling Ground Control on the same frequency. There were multiple air carrier aircraft on approach to both runways and shortly after switching frequencies, we heard a general aviation helicopter [advise ATC of] heavy vibrations and request immediate landing. Tower cleared the helicopter in distress to land on Taxiway Bravo, one of the two parallel taxiways to our landing runway. There were multiple transmissions to the helicopter about his status as well as to other aircraft on the field and approach while we were on final. Tower broadcast a request for all aircraft to be on 121.0 Tower frequency. The helicopter was subsequently cleared to hover-taxi on Bravo to the FBO. Tower instructed us to plan to turn onto Taxiway Alpha after clearing the runway; which is the parallel closest to the runway. After landing we turned off the runway at Kilo and could see that the helicopter was at the intersection of Kilo and Bravo turning into the FBO. The Captain took this turn slowly as it was hard to tell in the dark exactly what the helicopter was doing and how far away he was. Tower instructed us to taxi to the ramp via Alpha, Golf, Golf I. After getting established northbound on Alpha, I proceeded to do my After Landing Flow and called Operations on
the number 2 radio. The Captain had briefed the likelihood of parked aircraft and congestion in the ramp area and I planned to have my attention outside at that point, but in my mind while on Alpha we would be free of traffic conflict threats. The helicopter was now behind us, other carrier aircraft landing after us would likely roll out to the same intersection we had, and would also be behind us. I also thought I noticed the lights of an aircraft taking off on 17L to our right and so I did not think any aircraft were currently on or would be exiting the runway. My attention was on the After Landing Flows and calling Operations on the number 2 at that time, so I did not hear all transmissions taking place on Tower frequency (which the number I radio was still on as instructed). As we approached the turn to Taxiway Golf, I had just switched back to the number 1 radio and told the Captain that we were still going to Gate XX and that Operations requested the APU be left running for tow off the gate. The Captain was slowing for the turn and suddenly braked hard to a stop while turning our aircraft left off of center line. He said something like "where did that guy come from?" I looked right and saw the beacon of a GA aircraft high wing general aviation aircraft stopped just in front of and to the right of our right wing on Taxiway Golf reverse runway exit. This aircraft was extremely hard to see in the dark. His position and beacon lights blended in with the airport lighting and he did not have any taxi or landing lights illuminated. The GA aircraft Pilot queried Tower for instructions and said something about "the air carrier". The Tower replied that he had been instructed to give way to the air carrier. I don't know how far into the taxiway from the hold short line the GA aircraft was but I could see that we didn't have room to pass. The Tower transmitted that he couldn't see the GA aircraft. From the Tower's perspective the GA aircraft was directly to our right, close, and shorter and so not viewable over our fuselage. I transmitted that the GA aircraft would need to move first and that he had room to do so. Tower instructed the GA aircraft to go ahead and join Bravo and we were still cleared into the ramp. At no point during approach, landing, and taxi to the gate were we Issued traffic alerts by the Controller. We were aware of the helicopter because we heard the transmissions. I never heard a GA aircraft receiving instructions to give way to us. The Captain noticed something about the GA aircraft that grabbed his attention and his quick reaction avoided a potential collision. I believe the single controller in the tower cab was overloaded and that there was too much traffic in the terminal area for single Controller operations to be safe. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Synopsis Air carrier flight crew reported taking evasive action from a GA aircraft while taxiing at night after landing at AUS. The very busy Controller was apparently handling all ATC communications on multiple frequencies and failed to alert the crew about ground traffic.

Winds were just about calm. At about 200 AGL encountered first of three wake turbulence events, the next two both below approximately 1500 AGL. In fact just before rotation for takeoff I felt vortices try to pull nose left of centerline but was able to correct. The first wake encounter at about 200 ft rolled wings greater than 45 degrees left, then right as I worked to recover level wings. Then we encountered two more instances that required about full aileron deflection from the control yoke to regain level flight. It was one of the worst wake encounters I have experienced in my 28 years at [company]. Medium Category aircraft following Medium Category aircraft per definition is 0K, in theory anyway. However, I believe more distance is needed following heavier A321 takeoffs. have a fair amount of flight time in an MD80 so it was not too hard to fly through (although surprising to have three rapid roll events) but I wonder if the same could be said for the next, "newer on equipment" pilot to be surprised by this type of encounter. Hopefully that pilot will not over control the recovery maneuver/maneuvers.

Very suddenly the nose of the plane dropped followed by the right wing shooting straight up. I had my hands on the controls and I disconnected the autopilot and applied the maximum amount of aileron and full power. The airplane however kept rolling. We finally exited the wake at a nose low attitude. I broke off the approach and the FO requested a heading and altitude from CLT tower/approach. We climbed to 4,000 on a 120 heading and received delay vectors until we could sort out the extensive list of EICAS messages. I tried to re-engage the automation but we lost our air data. A short time later the EICAS shortened down to AUTOTHROTTLES FAIL, WINDSHEAR FAIL, STALL PROTECTION FAIL, and ANGLE OF ATTACK LIMIT FAIL. At this point the autopilot worked again but not the auto throttles. We cleaned up the plane and accelerated to 210 KTS. I then called back to the flight attendants to check on the situation in the cabin. Everyone fortunately had their seat belts on and was fine. I made a cabin PA to the passengers, then the FO ran the associated QRH items associated with each of the EICAS messages. The FO entered the new V speeds, reloaded the approach, ran another descent checklist, then we requested vectors back to Runway 23. On the ground we received ADS 2 (Air Data System) FAIL, ADS 3 FAIL messages.

We were on a published arrival into CLT. Once ATC gave us heading vectors to swing us around to the approach end of 36L, the captain and I both switched to the localizer freq 36L and went to green needles. As we neared the localizer course, ATC gave us a final vector to join the localizer for 36L. Just as we captured the localizer, my flight director made a sudden climbing right turn off the localizer course. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and turned back left to try to recapture the localizer. Although it was just a matter of only a couple of seconds, we got a traffic alert for inbound traffic on the localizer for 36C but no RA. The controller gave us a vector for 090 but since I had already turned back to westerly heading to try to rejoin, he gave us a heading Of 270 and canceled the approach clearance. At that time we reengaged the autopilot and it held the heading assignment. We quickly troubleshot the issue in attempting to figure out what caused the quick pitch and roll and could not find anything out of place. As the controller vectored us back around for another attempt to the ILS 36L, the captain and I did a positive transfer of controls and he became PF and I PM. ATC contacted us prior to the approach and issued a phone number to copy for a possible pilot deviation. As the controller issued us another vector to join the localizer, the captain armed the NAV button. As soon as he captured the localizer, the flight director again, pitched up and to the right as before. The captain caught it quick enough and disconnected the autopilot and stayed on course on the localizer manually. As we stabilized, I noticed on my FO side, my flight director was pitched up and stuck in an upright position and I did not have the glide slope green star and it stayed that way through the approach. As we continued prior to 1000 feet, pitch/roll commands kept appearing in place of the LOC and GS on at least 2 occasions. We rearmed the approach at least 2 times before it stabilized. By the final approach course beyond 1000 feet we were stable on the captain's side and he hand flew the approach down to just above minimums doing a great job of flying after all we had just went through. During the approach, we also received CAS messages of inboard ground spoilers and spoileron faults as well as the cargo door light message was on. The captain contacted ATC as requested and briefed them on the
avionics failure we had and they stated they would be submitting a report. Maintenance was called to the plane upon landing and we deplaned after the aircraft was put out of service. Narrative: 2 After receiving vectors from Charlotte approach control to intercept the 36L localizer, nav was armed, coupled to the FO's side. As soon as the course captured, the flight director made a sudden, sharp turn to the right. FO disconnected the auto pilot and attempted turn back to the approach course. Due to the speed and suddenness of the turn, we inadvertently encroached into the 36C approach course resulting in a T A. Charlotte approach issued an immediate vector to turn to a 090 heading, but we had turned to approximately 290 already. The controller then issued a 270 heading to clear us from both the 36C and 36L approach paths and to resequence us for an approach. The autopilot was reengaged and seemed to function normally. I opted to take the flying pilot duties to fly the approach. After receiving a vector to intercept the 36L localizer, I armed nav. As soon as the localizer captured the flight director again started to make a sharp right turn. I immediately disconnected the auto pilot and assumed manual control to remain on course. No further attempts were made to engage the autopilot for the remainder of the flight. As I was hand flying the approach, pitch and roll commands appeared on two occasions prior to 1000 feet. I reengaged approach each time and successfully landed the aircraft. Also, during the approach, we received intermittent inboard ground spoiler and spoileron messages and several cargo door CAS messages. Charlotte approach had advised us prior to the second approach that a possible pilot deviation had occurred and provided a telephone number for the Charlotte T RACON for us to call. I called after we arrived at the gate and after a brief discussion, was told that they would be submitting a report on the incident. I advised dispatch and maintenance control of the situation and entered the discrepancies in the aircraft logbook. Synopsis CRJ200 flight crew reported the flight director made a sudden climbing right turn off the localizer course during approach causing their aircraft to encroach into the adjacent approach path. The second approach resulted in the same anomaly, but the crew intervened quickly.

We experienced a sudden roll to the left of approximately 30 degrees, followed by a sudden roll to the right of approximately 70 degrees before regaining control. Our TCAS only identified one target which was located 12 NM at our 12 0'clock position and 1500 feet above us. We queried ATC as to the type of aircraft that was ahead of us and Los Angeles Center identified it as a 3767. The winds were indicating 40 kts from a quartering tailwind position. Apparently, the [B767] was in level flight crossing from our right to left. Their wake turbulence had drifted from a position right of our course to one directly in front of us, causing this event. We continued our climb once control was regained and had no further issue. There was no damage to the aircraft and no injuries to passengers or crew aboard. Synopsis Gulfstream 100 Captain reported a momentary loss of control in climb at FL320 from a wake turbulence encounter from a B767 crossing in front of them.

As soon as handle came out of detent aircraft rolled sharply left [and the] autopilot corrected with one unit of right aileron. AUTO SPEEDBRAKE EICAS message also displayed immediately. Stowed handle and aircraft rolled back to the right until the ailerons returned to neutral, then aircraft flew level. Redeployed speedbrakes with same response. Amount of speedbrakes handle made no difference in roll, stayed at one unit all the way to full speedbrakes. Disconnected autopilot when descending through FL190 and reattempted use of speedbrakes with the same results. Engaged center autopilot but had the same conditions so reengaged the left autopilot. Anytime the speedbrake handle was moved out of the down detent aircraft rolled left and autopilot added one unit right aileron to maintain wings level. Elected to keep speedbrake use to a minimum. Disconnected autopilot descending through 11000 feet as I wasn't comfortable with leaving it engaged with a possible flight control issue. Aircraft never rolled any of the times I hand-flew, seemed perfectly in trim. Received a request from ATC to slow from 250 to 190 knots for slowing traffic. FO had already run through the Auto Speedbrake QRH procedure which admonished not to arm the speedbrakes for landing. I advised that we should be ready for possible roll issues as flaps were extended and called for flaps I. No issues at the setting. I called for flaps 5 and started to get some left rolling without the speedbrakes being deployed. We had just checked on with Tower and notified them of our intentions. With flaps 30 roll was much more pronounced, requiring as much as 4 units of right aileron to maintain wings level. Winds were 250 deg at 10 knots so no crosswinds were involved. FO reminded me to use manual spoilers after touchdown. As soon as the aircraft touched down the need for right aileron disappeared. I selected reverse and the FO called "speedbrakes", which I then manually deployed. The rest of the landing rollout and runway exit were uneventful. ATC asked us if we needed any assistance, to which we replied no. Taxi to the gate was completed with no further issues. We elected to keep the spoilers deployed for maintenance while being aware of that in case an emergency egress situation should come up requiring their stowage.
Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Synopsis B757 flight crew reported an uncommanded roll occurred when the speed brakes were deployed and again when flaps were extended for landing.

We were at the published speed of 250 KIAS. Passing through 16,000 ft, we encountered wake turbulence. The aircraft suddenly and violently rolled right about 20 degrees, followed quickly by a 40 degree bank to the left. The airspeed fluctuated approximately 20 knots during the encounter. As the aircraft rolled left the autopilot disconnected. I turned on the continuous ignition, told the FO "my flight controls" and assumed manual control of the aircraft. I leveled the aircraft at 16,000 to attempt to stay above the flight path of the preceding traffic that caused the wake encounter. We informed ATC of our encounter and they gave us a new clearance to descend to 9,000. They informed us that we were following an aircraft that was 7.8 miles in front of us. I transferred control back to the FO and he flew a shallower descent to stay above the wake. I called back to the flight attendants to make sure everyone was 0k. There were no injuries. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The spacing between us and the aircraft in front of us led to a wake turbulence encounter. We had a quartering tailwind during this leg of the arrival, which made the wake linger in our flight path. Synopsis CRJ-700 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence at 16,000 ft on Arrival into CLT that resulted in a "violent" roll right and left.

The airspeed trend arrow went up into the barber pole, (we never got the clacker) so the Captain reduced power, as the airspeed and Vertical Speed continued to increase very rapidly, the Captain continued to reduce power and increase the pitch in an attempt to prevent the aircraft from overspeeding. The airspeed and Vertical Speed increased at such a rapid rate that we were unable to level off the FL 370, with the airspeed continuing to increase. We did not have any indications of mountain wave or windshear leading up to this point. I believe we were able to get the aircraft to slow down and level off at approximate FL380, with idle thrust. I immediately notified ATC of the severe updraft we had experienced and our deviation in altitude. The windshear event appeared to be over and we returned back to FL370 promptly. I called the Flight Attendants to check the status of the cabin, everyone was 0k thankfully. We notified Dispatch of the severe updraft/windshear, and the Captain wrote the aircraft up when we got to ZZZ. Maintenance met the airplane in with a printed report of the flight data, showing a 7900 fpm climb during the peak of the windshear event. The rest of the flight was mostly light chop/turbulence. We didn't encounter any more mountain wave or windshear. There isn't anything that we could have done to prevent this event. I believe we handled it as well as possible, given the extreme nature of the windshear/turbulence. Narrative: 2 Leveling off to cruise at FL370 climbing out in mostly smooth conditions we encountered severe turbulence in the form of a significant updraft. Pitch and thrust were managed as to not exceed aircraft limitations while maintaining positive aircraft control. Synopsis B737 flight crew reported an increase in airspeed and vertical speed that resulted in a max climb rate of 7,900 feet per minute and overshooting the assigned cruise altitude by approximately 1,000 feet.

Immediately after deploying the flight spoilers, we experienced an uncommanded and abrupt left turn. I disconnected the autopilot and stowed the flight spoilers. Two EICAS cautions messages presented, 0B SPOILERONS and FLT SPOILERS. We ran the QRH checklist and no further action was required. We were concerned that we may get another uncommanded left roll during the approach and landing, we [advised ATC] and asked for the ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Firefighting) to meet us at the runway. We landed without incident. Synopsis A CRJ-900 Captain reported an uncommanded left turn when he deployed the flight spoilers.

Our aircraft suddenly made a violent left banking roll and pitched up. The bank exceeded approximately 30 degrees of roll. We also had momentary loss of aircraft control. I was the Pilot Flying and immediately disconnected the autopilot and had to aggressively apply pitch and roll input in order to get the aircraft back under control. We immediately contacted ATC to report the incident and to Dispatch via ACARS. We also contacted the Flight Attendants to check their status of any injuries as well as the passengers. The Flight Attendants reported no injuries to themselves or the passengers. One Flight Attendant did report she had fallen on top of the passengers but was 0K. Approximately 30 minutes later the same Flight Attendant notified us that she was not feeling well and wanted to get replaced once we arrived. We asked her if she needed any medical attention and she refused. We continued with no other issues. Once we landed I called Dispatch, Maintenance Control, and the Chief Pilot on Call. A logbook entry was made due to the severe wake turbulence. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Synopsis 3737 flight crew reported a momentary loss of control climbing through FL360 after encountering severe wake turbulence from an MD-II at FL390.

After takeoff I adjusted the rudder trim slightly right. At this time the rudder trim selector knob pulled off of the rudder trim post. Assuming that the setscrew only backed out we placed the knob back on the post and continued the flight under normal operations. Once at an altitude of 10,000 feet, we briefed that we would not touch the rudder trim and leave it in the set position for the remainder of the flight. Approach cleared us direct an arrival waypoint and to cross at 8,000 feet. In the descent though 15,000 feet, out of habit I attempted to apply the slightest amount of right rudder trim to true the aircraft. At this time the rudder trim abruptly applied full uncommanded deflection to the right. Which was indicated on the primary EICAS page of nine full units right trim. Causing a severe skid at an indicated airspeed around 300 kts. The autopilot was immediately disconnected in efforts to regain control of the aircraft. At this time I was applying left rudder as hard as possible and asked for the pilot not flying to add rudder input as well in attempt to remove the airplane from the skid. During the skid the cabin host was walking up the main entry door to open the curtain. At which time cabin host was promptly commanded to take a seat. The non-flying pilot attempted to re-center the rudder trim using the unsecured trim knob. However, due to the knob not being attached pilot not flying was unable to move the rudder trim. At this time I notified ATC that we were having a problem with the rudder trim, we were off course and unable to make the crossing restriction. ATC cleared us direct to the airport and to maintain 6,000 feet. I called for the rudder trim circuit breakers to be pulled in an
effort to de-energize the trim motor. After the PNF was able to find an on board multi-tool that we keep in the cockpit, PNF was able to latch onto the trim post. When we realized this we pushed the CB's back in and attempted to re-center the rudder trim. The PNF discovered that the switch was not self-centering and that after moving the trim to the left PNF would have to move it back to the right to stop the movement of the motor. At which time I called for the CB's to be pulled again to ensure that the trim motor would not activate. During the skid fuel migrated to the left wing causing an imbalance between 300- 400 lbs. After regaining control of the aircraft I asked ATC to provide either delaying vectors or a hold. ATC cleared us for a present position hold at 6,000 feet and the autopilot was re-engaged in the holding pattern. I attempted to contact maintenance control by the use of the satellite phone to inquire if they would prefer for us to land at a nearby airport. However, due to the company's automated answering service we were unable to make contact with company. At this point I made the decision to continue to the original planned airport of arrival. After being cleared direct for the airport by ATC we were able rebalance the fuel and made a successful landing. After arrival a post flight inspection found no visible structural damage and no injuries were reported. After debriefing with the crew I made the decision that we were finished for the night as nerves were a bit shaken. Provide a discrete phone number for flights crews to be able to contact company without having to use the automated answering service. Narrative: 2 Enroute the PF tried to adjust rudder trim for a more coordinated flight, the rudder trim knob became dislodged from the rudder trim post. After a short discussion between the PF, and myself we decided to not make any more rudder trim corrections for the remainder of the flight and determined that it was logical to continue the flight. While in descent into our filed destination, I advised the PF that I was going to be "offline" to obtain the current weather and notify the FBO of our arrival. While "offline" I felt a sudden and rapid yaw from the airplane. It was at this time that I knew there was a problem. The PF immediately disconnected the autopilot as PF gained control of the airplane. At this point, I had noticed that PF's hand was on or around the rudder trim tab. With my head down in the cockpit I knew that the Rudder Trim Tab Knob had become dislodged with the rudder trim post. I grabbed for the trim tab knob and tried to get it to sit back down on the post but because of the yawing and uncontrolled flight profile, I was unable to do so. During this time I was instructed by the PF to disconnect the Rudder Trim circuit breakers, which I did. Returning to the task of correcting the rudder trim problem, I decided to abandon the knob and reach for a small Leatherman multi-tool that was in the cockpit when it was decided that the multi-tool was our best option for repair. The PF then instructed me to reconnect the circuit breakers to allow movement of the rudder trim motor, which I did. Using the multi-tool, I was able to turn the rudder trim post to the left to gain a more coordinated flight. While doing this, we both noticed that the rudder trim continued to travel in the opposite direction and the auto stop was not working, leaving me to try to find "center" and stop it there. After several attempts to gain positive control, we were successful. Once again, the PF instructed me to pull the rudder trim circuit breakers, which I did. We gained positive control of the aircraft and were able to re-engage the autopilot. It was at this time that I was able to come back "online" and able to hear all communications with ATC. I was given positive control of the aircraft by the PF as he contacted ATC and asked for a hold to try to contact Maintenance Control. We were unable to make contact, and decided that we would continue on to our original destination. We landed without incident and taxied to our FBO.
Synopsis G200 flight crew experienced a rudder hard-over after a rudder trim adjustment during which the rudder trim knob detached from the post. The crew was able to center the rudder trim using a Leatherman multi-tool then pulled the circuit breaker to prevent further movement.

Although the precipitation was steady, until that point the ride was smooth. We did NOT receive any windshear alerts. It's possible that we encountered wake turbulence from the previous aircraft. We immediately executed a go-around and encountered moderate turbulence, frequent lightning flashes and heavy precipitation. During the climb, as we approached level off, the Captain slowed the ascent but then continued above our target altitude most likely due to the turbulence. It was difficult to read the instruments and a fairly violent ride. We climbed approximately 280 ft above where we should have been. We corrected and resumed the MAP while ATC switched runways. We landed in heavy rain without further incident. It was the highest workload I've experience in my career. It was a little shocking to get rolled at such a low altitude but we handled the initial go-around fairly well. I think we were both distracted just trying to manage the aircraft once we encountered the turbulence on the go-around. As always, closer pilot communication and monitoring will help. Callback: 1 Reporter stated he was still not sure of the cause of the roll. Synopsis 3737 First Officer reported executing a go-around at MCO following a "violent" 30-40 degree roll on short final. It was not clear if the roll was a result of weather or a wake vortex encounter.

When Detected : In-flight Result.FIight Crew : Overcame Equipment Problem Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Aircraft Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 Our flight was normal until about 50 NM from the top of descent. My FO and I were setting up for the RNAV (RNP) Z RWY IOL when I noticed my inboard DU (Display Unit) and the upper DU blink. I then noticed a DSPLY SOURCE I annunciation in the bottom left corner of my outboard DU. I verbalized this to the FO and had him get out the QRH. He found the DSPLY SOURCE Checklist and proceeded to run it. About this time the annunciation went away. We reviewed the checklist and concurred that no further action was required. Because of the momentary failure we discussed the legality of executing a RNP approach and decided that we could do so. We briefed the arrival and the approach, and were just about to run the approach Descent Checklist when the DSPLY SOURCE I annunciation returned. Again we got out the QRH and started the checklist. The light again went out after about 60 seconds. As we were now past the TOD and had not received descent clearance we asked for a lower altitude and got the boards out. This was required to regain the path while honoring the 280 knot transition airspeed restriction that is published on the HHOOD3 RNAV arrival. About this point, the Flight Attendants called up wanting the seat belt sign on for light turbulence. We complied and were grateful for their call as cockpit workload had suddenly gotten very high and it might have been missed. The FO and I again discussed the wisdom of doing the RVAV RNP as the DSPLY SOURCE 1 annunciation intermittently was illuminated for a total of 5 or 6 times. We consulted QRH. Under the section "Malfunction OR Required Equipment" we were confused by the use of the word "OR" in the title. We decided it should read "of". We were also confused by the terminology used in the body of the text where it reads "not authorized for single or dual failure of any equipment item". We discussed this point and decided it meant any required equipment item as listed but were not completely sure of this interpretation. Looking at another page did not help us decide if an intermittent DSPLY SOURCE I annotation would be disqualifying for an RNP approach so I made the command decision to apply a very strict reading of QRH. I directed the FO to set up and brief the Columbia Visual backed up ILS IOL. He set up and quickly briefed the approach. About this time the DSPLY SOURCE 1 annunciation came on for several minutes so we ran the QRH checklist in its entirety and then came back together and verified that we had covered all bases with respect to the failure. To say that our RNAV descent was busy would be a massive understatement. The HHOOD3 has several required speed changes and multiple crossing restrictions. Dealing with an equipment malfunction, running a QRH, interpreting poorly written RNP guidance and briefing multiple approaches while trying to regain the path after a late descent clearance taxed us to the max. As far as I can tell, we flew the lateral, vertical and speed profile without error but this was very difficult to do considering the workload. I used the VSD mode on my Primary Flight Display and that was tremendously helpful in maintaining my overall situational awareness. (Very few of my FOs use this tool and they should as it gives instantaneous situational awareness of vertical path.) It helped greatly that I had a very capable FO on this leg. Using all of our CRM tools the two of us managed the threat and got everything done (including the much delayed approach descent checklist) by about FL200.
Past BLRUN on the HHOOD3 the DSPLY SOURCE I annunciation illuminated again and showed us something completely new. The FMC CDU scratchpad displayed DISCONTINUITY and I believe the aircraft went into CWS Pitch and Roll mode. I can't say that I saw CWS annunciated but as the autopilot did not disconnect and the flight path did not change it seems logical that we defaulted into CWS. I was very confused by this new failure mode and double clutched the waypoint under IL. This made BLRUN the active waypoint. This was very wrong as we were well past BLRUN and descending to cross SSDEE. I selected SSDEE to the scratchpad and moved to IL. I then confirmed it with the FO and executed it. By this point I had had enough. Cockpit workload was way too high, and our situational awareness had suddenly become way too low. Most concerning was that for an unknown reason the FMC had shown us a discontinuity and apparently resequenced itself to a waypoint we had already passed. I directed the FO to tell approach that we were unable the RNAV arrival and that we needed a vector. She gave us a 270 vector with no altitude assigned. We then asked her for an altitude assignment and she realized her mistake and cleared us to descend and maintain 5000 feet. As the flying pilot, I selected LVL CHG and HDG SEL and complied with our clearances as we were given vectors to a short visual approach. We successfully managed this new challenge by using CRM to recognize and verbalize the threat of a high energy approach. Once we realized we were getting the slam dunk, we used timely speedbrakes, an early gear extension and flaps 30 outside the marker to get back on the vertical profile and meet the stabilized approach criteria. The rest of the flight was uneventful. I believe that working together as a crew, we handled everything correctly and within required navigational standards. I am submitting this report mainly for tracking purposes. This is the second time I have had to deal with a degraded FMS on an RNAV arrival within the last 30 days. The first time, the FMC on the flying pilot's side failed, the autopilot disconnected, and went into CWS Pitch and Roll while descending into [a different airport]. That was also a very challenging scenario that I wish I had filed a report for but I did not. Regardless, even a momentary loss of flight path data on an RNAV arrival and has very significant implications for the safe conduct of the flight and it might be an excellent training scenario. It's even more critical if you are planning to use an RNP approach and then suddenly can't. My final concern is that as more and more airports are transitioning to RNP approaches (in particular in the Caribbean), even a minor FMC failure might mean that you can't land at your intended destination. I'm not sure that the company's current fuel policy addresses this issue and can envision a scenario where a crew finds itself challenged with few options and not much gas. Regardless, two failures that degrade my ability to fly an RNAV arrival and/or shoot an RNP Approach in less than 30 days has gotten my attention and I hope it gets yours. Synopsis B737 Captain reported multiple FMS malfunctions on the HHOOD3 Arrival and RNAV (RNP) Z Runway IOL to PDX. Captain reported a visual landing.

Gear was up and we were turning to a heading of 320 with the auto-pilot (AP) engaged set to level at 3000 feet. Almost immediately after leveling at 3000 feet the plane pitched aggressively up and started climbing. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and pitched down and trimmed down but there was real resistance (felt like a runaway trim). I believe the highest we climbed was 4000-4500 feet. My coplot pushed down with me to adjust altitude and he requested a heading and block altitude from ATC while we evaluated the situation. We hand-flew the plane. Having three options of landing overweight (we were above max landing weight), dump fuel or continue, as we were going to a Maintenance Facility we opted to continue to our destination and trouble shoot/monitor closely the situation. I advised my copilot to couple the AP to his side and try to re-engage the AP. We had enough fuel to fly to our destination at an altitude below 28,000 feet but since the AP was operating normally on the right side we continued flight with it operating uneventfully in that position in RVSM (FL400-FL410). We reacted immediately and advised ATC immediately after taking rapid corrective action. We train for this and will continue to do so. I am sorry if we caused aggravation and we appreciate the immediate assistance provided to us by ATC. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional inforr•nation.]

We also were instructed to maintain 270 kts until ZZZZZ intersection and then resume published speeds. 6,000 ft had been put into the altitude window for the bottom altitude of the profile descent and DES was indicated on the FMA for a managed descent. Aircraft was being operated with autopilot 2 engaged. FO was PF and is a new hire. We were both looking at the FO's MCDU as I was explaining how to put the 270 knot restriction on the DES page. We both felt the plane abruptly pitch up and begin a zoom climb and depart FL370. I looked at all the instruments to determine why the aircraft started the climb, initially believing that a protection had been activated or we had suffered an undue activation of alpha protection malfunction, but neither was the case. AP never disengaged on its own. AP was disconnected and aircraft was leveled at about 38,800 ft then a descent was begun. I advised ATC Of the event. AP 2 was then reengaged. It appeared that the aircraft was starting to climb again so AP 2 was again disconnected. We engaged AP I and resumed normal operations on that autopilot.

First Officer (FO) was flying, autopilot on, aircraft configuration was clean and we were steady state at 240-250 knots. I heard the "stab in motion" aural go off for what I perceived as too long for normal operations, especially with the aircraft configuration. I assumed control Of the aircraft and disconnected the stab trim. I perceived a nose down (yoke moving fwd) motion just prior to disconnecting the trim. I called for the memory items for stab trim runaway, and the QRH. The FO accomplished the required checklists. I had the aircraft and the radios. We [advised ATC], requested an immediate return to [departure airport] and a descent. I was fighting a nose down trim condition which seemed best at around 230 knots. We got vectored for an approach and requested a long final. Somewhere in there the FO got the landing data and we determined we had sufficient runway available (155%). As the flaps came out, the nose down trim feel abated for the most part. We were fast at 1000 feet but I was able to get to ref 20 flaps plus a few by 500 feet. Uneventful landing ensued. WX was low ceilings, 3NM vis in mod rain, wind 90 degrees left wind, wet runway. We missed the thrust reversers. Probably did not run the landing checklist with all that was going on. When I pulled them on landing, I got the caution msgs, closed the reversers, armed the switches and then redeployed them without further incident. Still stopped with plenty of runway remaining.

Result.GeneraI : Physical Injury / Incapacitation Result.FIight Crew : Overcame Equipment Problem Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Aircraft Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 While in cruise at FL350 at Mach .75 and 54 minutes into the flight (in VMC conditions; in still air; with no turbulence being alerted to us, the flight crew by ATC or by PIREPS) the autopilot was engaged until the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft did an abrupt pitch up and stick shaker occurred. The aircraft climbed approximately 200 feet during this event. The aircraft was returned back to FL350 and autopilot was reengaged. No EICAS message occurred however we reviewed the pitch trim runaway checklist even though there was no EICAS message. From the time the autopilot disengaged to the stick shaker was less than 2 seconds. Recovery of the aircraft was immediate with myself (pilot flying) and the FO pushing on the yoke forward for this stall recovery incident. ATC was not notified of any flight deviation since the total incident lasted less than 20 seconds from the start to recovery back at FL350. ATC did not question our altitude change. I contacted the FAs and no passengers were injured. FA #2 was injured to where she sustained a bloody lip and twisted foot. I asked if she was 0k or needed immediate medical care. She indicated she was not in need of medical care thus we continued to ZZZ which was less than I hour away. Once the aircraft was in cruise back at FL350, as indicated above, I evaluated the aircraft stability, flight characteristics and safety of the passengers and since there were no issues, I did not declare an emergency. After the event the aircraft preformed as usual and autopilot was reengaged and speed brakes were used. After the event I monitored the pitch trim indicator on the EICAS and it reflected between 2.5 and 2.7 on the trim with the autopilot engaged. After the event the maintenance personnel that inspected the aircraft indicated the initial cause was a disagreement with the elevator servo. In looking at the event a week later, it appears over time at cruise, the aircraft reconfiguring to a pitch up attitude due to an elevator/servo disagreement and the autopilot disengaged since it was not able to hold a level altitude with this configuration. Thus when the autopilot disengaged the aircraft was configured in a pitch up attitude and we pitched up to a stick shaker notification. The recovery of this event was an immediate response from myself and the FO. The recovery Of the aircraft was what we were taught in recovery of a stall at high altitude. This was my first sequence after recurrent to which a high altitude stall was demonstrated in the simulator. The only difference was in the simulator the airspeed was reduced and in this real life situation the aircraft did not lose airspeed but was placed in an immediate pitch up attitude. Synopsis EMB175 Captain reported an autopilot disengagement and abrupt pitch up at FL350. Later, maintenance inspection revealed a disagreement with the elevator servo.

Person : Flight Crew When Detected : Taxi Result.General : Flight Cancelled / Delayed Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : Airport Contributing Factors / Situations : Human Factors Primary Problem : Human Factors Narrative: 1 I was scheduled to operate [multiple flights]. Upon taxi out in ZZZ we were assigned by ATC to back taxi on [the] runway to perform 180 degree turn at the end for takeoff. This was due to taxiway closures and airport construction. My First Officer pointed out that they had just previously assigned the same clearance to an aircraft before us. Since taxiway A was part of the closures and since other aircraft were given the same clearance it led me to believe that I had no other option for departure. After we were clear of the ramp and positioned on the parallel taxiway I stopped the aircraft, set the parking break and we performed all briefings and pre-takeoff checks and checklists. I then handed my First Officer my iPad opened to the [procedures] and asked him to locate the description of the 180 degree maneuver so we could review it. I told him I had only done this maneuver once in my upgrade training in the SIM and I wanted to be sure that we would be doing it correctly. After review of the [procedure] we entered [the] runway at taxiway D and began to back taxi to the end of the runway. As I began the maneuver I solicited my First Officer's input since we had reviewed the procedure together. Both of us seemingly were in agreement throughout the maneuver. Just prior to beginning my hard over turn to the right my First Officer stated that he wouldn't go much further. I commented that I had not yet reached the runway edge but then began the right turn almost immediately thereafter. My First Officer was the first one to think that we were potentially off the runway. Since the aircraft seemed sluggish I boosted the power to see if it would continue its turn. It was at this point that it became obvious to me that he was correct. I then set the parking brake. We contacted the tower and notified them then contacted Operations. We started the APU then shutdown both engines. I contacted Operations to advise them of the situation. We remained with the aircraft until the decision was made to wait for recovery assistance. At that point we exited the aircraft and proceeded to the gateway. We submitted to the drug and alcohol test, contacted crew scheduling then went to the hotel until our scheduled jumpseat. In hindsight I should have queried ATC about any other options for departure that would not require the back taxi. As we waited at the end of the runway for assistance I noticed the segment of taxiway between [two parallel runways] appeared to be open and usable. This would have meant that we could have back taxied made the right onto the taxiway and used [the parallel runway] for departure. Additionally, I believe that seeing and performing the maneuver on Operating Experience would have been helpful and should be incorporated into our training in the future. Narrative: 2

Person : Flight Crew When Detected : In-flight Result.FIight Crew : FLC Overrode Automation Assessments Contributing Factors / Situations : ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings Contributing Factors / Situations : Human Factors Primary Problem : Human Factors Narrative: 1 We were in the process of flying an uneventful approach at the end of an uneventful flight. The approach was the visual approach to runway 32 in IND. We were following an aircraft and another aircraft was about to depart and we assume that one of these aircraft, perhaps both, interfered with the glideslope signal. As IS usual, we were backing up the visual approach with the ILS and on autopilot as well. When the interference occurred, it was sudden and surprising in intensity. I have seen this occur many times throughout the years, and without question this was the worst I've seen. As the glideslope deviated upward, the aircraft of course went with it and initiated a steep pitch attitude and almost full power. The first officer (FO)was caught unaware as this was new to him, and in the moment's indecision, I assumed the controls and stabilized the aircraft. I was able to return to a stable configured flight path at about 1,100-1,200 ft, and decided to maintain controls for the remainder of the approach, as I didn't feel it appropriate to transfer controls at that point of the approach. We then landed without further incident. A check airman was on the jumpseat and was able to provide some added and informed
insight to a discussion we all had upon reaching the parking point. The FO seemed slightly shaken, and we veterans were surprised as well, at how quickly the aircraft reacted to a disrupted glideslope indication. The pitch and power inputs were drastic; personally, I'd like a download of the data to see just what it did. It was a vivid demonstration to the FO of what this particular situation can do to a pilot in that you can have a pristine day that suddenly goes wrong. Without intervention, I'm not sure what state the aircraft would have achieved with the oscillation that followed. The downward pitch and excessive power input would probably have resulted in a potential CFIT threat. As well, indecision as to what action to take can create issues hazardous to a positive outcome of the flight. Absent a decision to correct the flight path or to call for a go- around, I needed to intervene, which provided a vivid and excellent teaching moment for the FO who now has seen an authentic representation of how quickly scenarios can change in this environment. We decided to report this since we do believe it was an upset. There may be an issue with the glideslope itself and may need to be addressed by the airport authority as this scenario is easily repeated. The only way to get experience is to get experience. The FO needed it, and now he has some more. Because I have some, we corrected it to an uneventful outcome. Narrative: 2 While on final approach to IND RWY 32 at approximately the FAF, IND Tower cleared an aircraft onto RWY 32. The aircraft passed through and interrupted the RWY 32 Glide Slope transmission. The FO had the FMS coupled to the ILS 32. The disruption caused a GS indication that was nose high (estimated 10 degrees) which the autopilot (AP) tracked and the autothrottle advanced to takeoff thrust. FO's reaction to this inflight upset was delayed, (fixation/confusion on the abrupt pitch/thrust change), prompting the CA to announce, and take the flight controls. The CA immediately and smoothly returned the aircraft to the ILS glide path and because being in a critical phase of flight, landed the aircraft. Several contributing factors. I) FO was on a line check with a check airman jumpseat observing him. He was a little nervous. 2) Weather was clear with light to moderate winds. This crew was performing well and were literally minutes away from landing. 3) FO was a recent new hire. Because of that, I am assuming he had low time in CFR Part 121 operations. 4) FO described that he had never encountered this kind of GS anomaly before and was unfamiliar with ground GS aircraft disruptions. Crew knowledge and experience are the only way to prevent this event. Conclusion: Excellent rapid control by the CA. Excellent learning experience for the FO. Narrative: 3 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Synopsis Air carrier flight crew reported an interrupted glideslope signal at IND caused the aircraft to pitch up while on autopilot. The Captain took control from the First Officer and landed the aircraft.

When we checked the airspeed indicators we noticed that the FO's airspeed was indicating lower than mine and the standby airspeed indicator. As we accelerated there was no change in his airspeed indicator. Based on this I thought there was a blockage of pitot tube 2. The PM pulled out the QRH and it instructed us to do an ADC (Air Data Computer) reversion. This also required us to descend out of RVSM airspace. ATC assigned us FL270 and we began to descend. We descended with the autopilot on. As we descended we noticed the standby IAS and Captain side no longer matched up. Captain side IAS was descending and acting like an altimeter. This caused some uncertainty initially as we were not sure which one to believe. We were asked to increase our descent by ATC so I increased the VS to 2000 fpm. Shortly after this the airplane did an uncommanded pitch down and we disconnected the autopilot. It was at this point smoke or water vapor came pouring in through the window seals. I wasn't sure which it was at first, but it made me worried about our pressurization and we were still at FL300 and hand flying. I checked the cabin pressure on the EICAS and it seemed normal. About at this point we also experienced a failure of both ADCs as we got red Xs across our instruments. I also saw an IC-600 failure message on the EICAS and the
first officer reported seeing a PRESN auto fail message. We [advised ATC] and proceeded to ZZZ. We received radar vectors there. As we descended the systems came back online and by the time we were getting vectors to ILS all indications were normal again. At some point I turned the autopilot back on but it kicked off after we intercepted the localizer as the localizer was swaying back and forth. After that we landed uneventfully at ZZZ. Bad weather, instrument failure, task saturation. The autopilot pitch down was caused by me leaving the autopilot on after I should have disconnected it. At the time I was busy and it did not occur to me that I should turn the autopilot off. At that time I was busy trying to decide which airspeed indication I could rely on and trying to figure out what was going on. Narrative: 2 The flight started about 1.5 hours delayed due to a line of severe weather. Our filed route took us north with expected vectors around the west side of the most severe elements of the line. Previous aircraft had flown through our route without any issues. We reached our cruising altitude of 37,000 ft. and were leveled off for approximately 9 minutes before we received an amber IAS indication on the PFDs. Taking note of the three airspeeds revealed the FO side was in disagreement with the standby and captain's side PFD. I pulled the QRH. The guidance provided stated to compare data with the standby indicator and if required use cross-side data by pressing the appropriate reversionary button. We did this resulting in the FO side airspeed reading in agreement with the captain's side and standby instruments. Further guidance also instructed us to descend below RVSM so I as the PM called ATC and requested a non RVSM altitude for a minor issue with our airspeed indications. At that point the problem seemed solved and we intended to continue as planned. It was during the descent, however, that the real alarming airspeed indications began to manifest. As we got lower, all three airspeed indications fell out of agreement and all trended lower with each bit Of altitude lost. Obviously we were both extremely alarmed at this indication and I began thinking out loud about what would cause the result. My thought was that a partial pitot tube blockage which prevent air from entering the tube but not preventing it from escaping would possibly result in this reading. This thinking was based on static pressure continually increasing as we descended but ram air pressure remaining unchanged. This would result in an ever increasing static to ram air pressure ratio thus resulting in a lower airspeed indication. My mind immediately went to [a recent aircraft accident] which crashed due to pitot tube blockage and an improper pitch and power setting in response to inaccurate airspeed indications. The time spent during the descent while the airspeed was rolling back was incredibly stressful as it was IMC in the thin air Of 35,000+ feet. I am certain both Of our minds were trying to figure out as rapidly as possible what was happening in order to best figure out how to handle the problem. Any EICAS indications which may or may not have existed during that period went unnoticed as the evaluation of whether or not a stall at 30 something thousand feet was imminent took precedence over all other things. Once I was done verbalizing my theory on the pitot tube blockage and we both agreed it was a real possibility, our focus became pitch and power and working together to ensure the aircraft continued to fly safely in the descent. Up until this point the captain had elected to continue to let the autopilot fly, perhaps due to the thin air, but we were both very aware of the probable need to disconnect it when our airspeed indication read very low. I don't think either of us knew for sure what the Autopilot was going to do at such low airspeeds which in hindsight should have been a trigger for the captain to hand fly the aircraft but there was a lot to think about at that
point. When the airspeed indication (not actual airspeed) read dangerously low the autopilot commanded a very rapid pitch down attitude. The captain immediately disconnected the autopilot and I jumped on the controls with him to pull the nose back up to a safe descent attitude while also trimming the nose up to relieve the pressure. I notified ATC of our situation. I asked if there was any known VMC in the area but none could be found. ATC offered ZZZ as the closest suitable airport and provided vectors to the field. At some point during our continued descent we lost all airspeed and altitude indications as both PFD's were covered in red Xs. A number of EICAS indications were presented which again took a back seat to flying the aircraft, getting setup to land at an airport now less than 30 miles away with a Metar of TSRA over ZZZ. Honestly there was so much going on as the PM that the only EICAS message that was clearly noted in my head was PRESN auto FAIL. Perhaps this was because it seemed like a completely new problem in the storm of events. It was somewhere around this time, likely before I noticed PRESN auto FAIL, that our windows were completely fogged over and both the Captain and FO side windows were venting in visible water vapor. The windows were so obstructed that I initially thought we had severe clear ice buildup on our windows further adding to my workload as it produced even more stress to an already very stressful event. Concerns of seeing a runway with an obstructed windscreens became the next thought in my head so I moved on to trying to solve that problem. There were no indications of failed windshield heat, however, I checked the windshield heat buttons at least three times to make sure they were on and even cycled the captain's side as I have never seen so much condensation on a heated windscreen before. I eventually had a moment to grab the box of tissues we thankfully had on the fight deck and was relieved to find our visibility issues were solved after wiping down the front windscreens. While we didn't get into VMC conditions until around 2,000 feet on the approach, we did at some point during our descent into ZZZ get all of our indications back and in agreement with no reversions. To the best of my knowledge we were within 10 miles of the field and getting vectors for the ILS when our instrumentation resumed what at least appeared to be a normal operating condition. I would be dishonest if I said I wasn't very skeptical of all instrument indications at that point after all we had been through thus far. Because the indications were in agreement the Captain elected to reengage the autopilot again for our arrival into ZZZ. Keep in mind from the point of failure when the Captain took the controls from the autopilot until right now in the scenario, all that I have been doing from the right seat has been in conjunction with being equally focused on watching the captain's flying to back him up on his pitch and power. Nothing was more important in my mind than 1. Preventing a stall and 2. Ensuring we didn't descend the aircraft into the ground due to task saturation. Our descent into ZZZ was constant moderate precipitation and despite an ATIS Indicating TSRA, Approach had two aircraft which had recently landed, thus encouraging us to continue into ZZZ. In one last reminder from the aircraft to never stop flying until you are safely on the ground, the autopilot started badly s-turning on the localizer and the autopilot disengaged itself. The captain of course took the controls again and hand flew the ILS to the runway to land without any further issues. Some of the major threats included severe weather along the route Of flight as well as a malfunctioning aircraft with incorrect indications provided by the instrumentation. The most significant factor was the uncommanded pitch down by the autopilot due to not hand flying sooner. That would stand out to me as our biggest error. We both were unsure of what was going to happen with the autopilot in charge so allowing the autopilot to take it for as long as we did was not necessarily wise. It did, however, free up both of our brains a bit more to decide what was happening and how to respond. The only positive I can take from this was we were at least watching the airplane like a hawk ready to take corrective action immediately if a proper pitch attitude wasn't maintained. As soon as it was apparent
the autopilot wasn't up to the task, we took over. We experienced a very nasty mix of major task saturation which couldn't be aided by an autopilot as well as honest to goodness fear. Stalling the airplane in IMC was hard to not think about, nor did I Wish to try. Aviate-Navigate-Communicate was definitely our approach. It doesn't do any good to flip through a QRH while death spiraling toward the ground after a stall. That being said, at no time did I ever make a decision to not follow the QRH. I simply did not have enough free resources to get there before the messages eventually cleared and the PFD's appeared normal again. With so much going on, including the water vapor and suspected icing, working with ATC to get us to ZZZ, having to consider the weather and the T SRA in the AT IS, getting numbers for the runway, setting up frequencies, briefing approaches and running the arrival check and sending a diversion report to dispatch, I simply never had the time. Had this been a sim where the consideration of myself and other peoples lives were not on the line, I probably would have been better able to address the EICAS messages which may or may not have corrected our instrument indications. Unfortunately, this was the real world and we both did the best we could with everything which was thrown at us. While I feel overall we did 0k with the situation presented to us, there are always things you could do better. Certainly as previously mentioned, the autopilot should have been disconnected sooner in order to prevent the need to take sudden corrective action. I do wish I had been able to get to the QRH after the initial ADC (Air Data Computer) reversion. I really tried my best to clear my mind and focus on the tasks required. Unfortunately, I couldn't stop hyper focusing on the aircraft state and trusting the Captain to fly correctly. It wasn't because I didn't generally trust his skills, it was simply a scenario which is very rare (never happened in my experience) and had a severe enough outcome (high altitude stall) if improperly executed that I felt backing hm up took priority. Especially since with all that had gone wrong, my trust of any indication outside of the standby indicator (even my trust here wasn't very strong) was gone, despite what they were or were not reading. Synopsis EMB145 flight crew reported an airspeed indication failure at FL370 in IMC with thunderstorms nearby. The flight diverted to the nearest suitable airport with airspeed returning to normal during the approach.

The FO and I had just been discussing the possibility Of an arrival change, due to the landing configuration at destination and were referencing our iPads in anticipation of the change. When I returned my attention to the instruments the aircraft was rolling through 60 degrees of bank. It took a few moments to process what the aircraft was doing. At approximately 70 degrees of bank I disconnected the #1 autopilot and initiated a recovery. Approximately 500 feet of altitude was lost during the recovery. With control of the aircraft reestablished, we notified ATC of the deviation. ATC then directed us to descend to FL240. Although noticeable to the passengers and cabin crew, the seatbelt sign was on and no injuries were reported. The remainder of the flight was unremarkable. After landing, I entered the anomaly in the logbook and spoke with Maintenance before leaving the aircraft. I am still puzzled as to the cause of roll, but I am grateful for the unusual attitude recovery training we practice at recurrent.

All fuel pumps had been on since preflight. A lot of yaw and bank. Disconnected auto flight and throttles. Started descent. Checked engine rotating and turned on continuous relight. Left ECAM disappeared or diminished. Was it at idle or sub idle? I don't know. Lights but no horn. Checked that the engine responded to throttle movement then left it at idle and flew with auto throttles disconnected. Only used the engine for thrust reverse on landing and to taxi. Did the long checklist. Contacted ATC. They asked if we wanted the trucks ready or rolled. While I was thinking they made the decision. I would have rolled the trucks also. I think they could have gotten in place sooner as I had a lot of localizer wobble and had to disengage the autopilot. I wonder if the trucks crossed the beam? I forgot to ask the fire chief. Had to stay high longer due to TCAS alert. I slowed rate of descent to avoid RCAS. After the traffic passed I used boards to get down. MEL for bad pack on the side of the good engine. Made airflow path in case we lost the engine with the good pack. I could have used APU for pressurization and I would have if we were really single engine. I planned on using both engines in the event of a go around. And certainly would have used number two if anything happened to number one. Didn't turn off stuff in the checklist since the engine was still running. I probably should have started the APU a little earlier (before we got to it in the checklist) although it was backup only. Did a 20 flap landing at 151 knots. Very smooth just under max landing gross weight. Thrust reversers on both engines. Min auto brakes. Cleared runway. Stopped as requested then continued taxi to hangar gate and transloaded. Great backup and initiative by the FO. For example, when we shut down, he told me the stairs were on the wrong side for the MEL slide inop. And I was busier than normal with manual throttles and he assumed some of my duties in addition to his own. Very nicely done on his part. Talked to fire chief. They have three levels of alert. I think it would be good info to incorporate in training.
Cause: Engine failed or went to idle, so quickly that I thought it had failed. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information]. Synopsis A300 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after Number 2 engine abruptly rolled back to idle.

When we got to the gate the plane was late inbound. When we got on the plane the agent wanted to board right away. I checked with the Captain and he said we had mechanics on board. The mechanics said not to board. The agent boarded anyway. We had lots of issues with this plane. Inflight Entertainment (IFE) did not work a latch in the back was totally gone and some cockpit issues plus the APU did not work so it was very hot on the plane. We closed the 2L and armed our doors. Then the Captain said the mechanics needed to get back on so we disarmed all doors. We reopened the 2L door to let the mechanics back on for an issue in the cockpit. I was in the IL lav when I smelled a burning electrical odor. Before I could open the door (about 2 seconds) the lav was full of smoke. I heard someone say smoke in the cockpit, smoke in the cockpit. When I looked to the right I could not see past row 2 because of the whitish yellowish smoke. The smoke was burning my eyes and throat. I turned to my left to tell the Captain (I could not get to the cockpit because 2 mechanics and an agent were in the door) when I heard evacuate over the P.A. The Business class passengers were already up and moving to the 2L door. The D FA and I got our passengers out the 2L door and helped with the flow of passengers while yelling our commands. I was at the door with the E and we had the passengers going out side by side for faster flow. The F started to stop passengers and take their bags from them I said let them go it's faster. You need to go to your exit, she did not go. I saw a lot of passengers with their roll-aboards. Then I heard over the PA, stop the evacuation. I turned and ran to the cockpit (the D is arriving at the same time). I tell the Captain that the passengers cannot breath and the smoke is thick. I get on the PA and say continue the evacuation. The Captain says someone has blown a slide and for me to go back and see where it is. I run to the back down the aircraft left aisle. About 30 passengers are left on the plane and they are trying to get their luggage out of the overhead bins even though we are yelling get out leave everything. I see the 3L door is open with no slide and a passenger and her 2 children are looking out the door (3L) and trying to decide if they should jump. I point and tell them to go to the boarding door and I put the strap across the door. I can see 3R is open with a slide inflated and the G is with passengers at that door. 4L and 4R have slides inflated and the C and B are with their respective door. I tell the FA's to check the cabin and lavs behind me and make sure everyone is off and for them to get off the plane. I tell the Captain that we have 3 slides inflated and all the passengers are off. The firemen board at this time and they want all crew off except the A and the cockpit. The FAs get off onto the jetway and the F tells them not to go to the gate area because the company will not pay you if you get off the plane. I tell them to go to the gate area now. I ask if everyone is 0k. The K says she needs oxygen and I put her on oxygen from the plane. I get her to the gate area and get her bags for her and then I go back and talk to the firemen. They send us all to the gate area and the paramedics check everyone out. One FA has high blood pressure and another has asthma problems. We are all coughing and have burning itchy eyes. I am on the phone with the company most of the time that we are in the gate area. About 4 hours I am told. I check on my crew and I am working to get us transportation to the hospital then to the hotel. The agent is a tremendous help with a bus, paramedics extra. I check on a few passengers that are in the gate area. We go to the hospital and we are there about 5 hours or so getting blood work. We have no chairs to sit on and end up on the floor. They take the K first because she has Lupus and then checkout the C with the high blood pressure and then the F then the rest of us. [The] agent puts drinks and food on her own credit card because we have not had anything since we left the hotel. We get back to the hotel. We get to our rooms and meet back in 45 minutes to eat and see if we have been released from duty yet. The Captain tells us [someone] might want to talk to us and not to have any alcohol
because we are not released from duty yet. When I meet back in the restaurant a few of the FAs are having a drink. I said the Captain and I have told you not to drink. I was told they can do what they want after such a hard day. Long argument and they continued to drink. The Captain came in and told them the same thing and again they refused to listen. I am going to the front desk for phone calls because I do not have international calling and my battery is low. The F keeps taking the phone from me to talk to [the company]. I am having to argue with her to get my phone calls. She wanted to be in charge and that really made my job harder and I missed some important information. No one in the company seemed to know that I was A FA. I finally [had a meeting about the event] in the hotel. Just gave him the basics about what I saw. At midnight I went back to the restaurant and had a few bites of my cold food. I tried to get the FAs to tell me what flight they wanted to take home. All I got was argument. I told them they could go when they felt comfortable to leave. I was trying to set up their flights home. The [investigators] wanted to talk to the ones that had deployed the slides so they had to stay. I chose the first flight the next day. Six of us went on the early flight. We were listed as non-revenue instead of deadheading so the agent would not give us a boarding card because we did not check in 24 hours ahead. More stress. Finally get our seats and get on the plane home. The pressure to board has gotten ridiculous and unsafe. Getting the plane off the gate at all cost is not safe. Boarding and on time is more important than safety. We have to have the entire crew briefings back. Our CRM is so important. Most briefings from the cockpit (sometimes not the Captain) consist of air time and maybe a weather report. The biggest issue for this flight was pressure to board and get off the gate. Narrative: 2 I was standing in the galley between 2L & 2R. Flight Attendant (FA) said, "Smoke!" Suddenly noticed smoke at the ceiling near 2R. I looked down the aisle and smoke filled the cabin in less than 3 seconds. FA "H" was standing near 2R. I said, "We have to call the Captain and evacuate!" I reached for the phone at 2R. I called the Captain and there was no answer. I pressed the PA button and announced, "Evacuate, Evacuate!" The smoke was still there and there was a smell of an electrical fire. We proceeded to evacuate. The Captain came on over the PA and said, "Stop the evacuation." I'm not sure at this point if got back on the PA or just said out loud, "We need to keep evacuating!" The Captain did not see the smoke or smell the fumes so I just kept on evacuating. I think at some point I did hear the Captain come back on and say, "Evacuate!" We continued the evacuation until all the passengers were off. This might be a lesson that if the mechanics are on and say, "We are not ready to board", perhaps the Operations Manager, should respect that and not board until they are ready. I remember she and I had a bit of a disagreement about the boarding. She pressured the front mechanic to board until he finally said yes. The mechanic in the back did not want to board. I clearly told her that and she said, "I will deal with that later." I'm not sure if that would have made a difference in the event but it did seem rushed to board them and then the passengers sat on the airplane another hour until we actually closed the door the first time.

The turbulence lasted between 15-20
minutes and the Captain did not give any advance notice to our cabin crew. Movement was impossible in the cabin, items were falling around in the bathrooms, and people were extremely scared. We experienced violent altitude changes, slamming of the aircraft side- to-side, rapid pitch and rolls, and sudden/aggressive drops. During said turbulence, the captain never made any PA to advise us of any significant turbulence nor made any attempt to notify the crew via the interphone system at any point. We were not advised of how long the turbulence was expected to last, and passengers were given no updates until I provided one in an effort to comfort terrified passengers. The cockpit crew stated they were unaware of any weather/turbulence reports, which according to two other mainline pilots I spoke with following this incident stated that they would have easily and reasonably forecasted appreciable turbulence based on other immediately available weather factors in reference to ZZZ airport approach/arrival this afternoon, including reports of windshear. Separately, it is my hope that our pilots made accurate, timely and appropriate notifications during this turbulence to ZZZ ATC to assist other approaching aircraft. It is our cabin crews' concern that the communication here was so poor, or complacency was at its highest, that it may have been overlooked. Note: The captain mentioned significant pitching of the nose at times during the approach and 41-mph wind gusts, and agreed the ride conditions were poor. I would also add that in other instances we have diverted for much less. At the conclusion of the flight, and after arriving at the gate, I spoke with the captain via the interphone to inquire about the turbulence and lack of communication and ultimately met with him and the entire crew to discuss it in the forward galley. What resulted was the cabin crew feeling dismissed as the captain said that any announcement wouldn't have changed any of the outcome. While that statement is true, it is an unconscionable approach to piloting and communicating amongst a team of crew members tasked with passenger comfort and safety. The importance of CRM - providing accurate, timely, and needed communication with passengers and crew - is seriously missing with this cockpit crew. Is should be noted that the B flight attendant has been flying for [many] years and commented on how poorly this was handled by the cockpit, and how it was the worst turbulence she has encountered in her career. The A flight attendant also [noticed] the bathroom vanity on the bathroom floor, which fell during the hard landing. The captain was made aware that reports would be filed in response to the way this situation was handled. It should be noted that all times the cabin crew remained professional and fair at all times while communicating our concerns with the pilots on this flight segment. Our company simply must instill in their pilots the fundamentals of CRM and the importance of communication with crews and passengers. This is a noticeable issue with our legacy pilots that we are now flying with more frequently. Due to constant cockpit crew changes, it is noticeable and frightening the diminishing art and importance of crew communication. Never in my years of flying have I witnessed such a decline in CRM. This must be addressed. Synopsis
A319 Flight Attendant reported a lack of communication from the cockpit during descent in severe turbulence.

This encounter lasted for approximately 10 minutes with the severe turbulence lasting about 3 to 5 minutes. In my over 20,000 hours and 40 years of flying experience I have never encountered turbulence of this severity lasting for such an extended period of time. In cruise flight I attempted to use WSI but was unable to achieve a WIFI connection. Therefore I relied on my preflight data and our flight plan, which showed the worst ride conditions to be approximately the Grand Canyon area. During preflight a conversation with the inbound crew indicated this was the area they encountered the worst rides. In the vicinity of Durango, CO, we began to hear aircraft reporting mountain wave activity and some moderate turbulence over the Rockies. I turned on the seat belt sign and instructed the F/A's via intercom to clean up the cabin and take their jump seats. We also started to pick up light mountain wave and light to moderate chop as we proceeded east. During this time we were watching a 125-knot tail wind slowly bleed off to a 54 knot quartering tailwind. The turbulence and chop seemed to increase but the mountain wave seemed to settle down a bit. The wind bleed off reminded me of an experience I had in the same vicinity when I had less than 100 hours on the 737. That time wind shift had led to an aircraft over speed. So this time we used the opportunity to talk about 737 throttle response and spool up time. To back up my earlier instructions and make an impression on the passengers to stay in their seats, I made a PA instruction the F/A's to take their jump seats. I followed this up with an intercom conversation with the F/A's checking to make sure they were seated, the cabin was secure, and telling them how long I thought these conditions might last. At some point during this time we inquired from ATC about the rides lower as the mountain wave continued. We were told that the rides were about the same at all altitudes. Having hit a fairly smooth area, we decided to stay at FL 370. The mountain wave activity started to pick up in intensity. I attempted to contact ATC for clearance to a lower altitude, but the frequency was blocked with other aircraft enquiring about or reporting ride conditions. Finally with the airspeed bleeding off in mountain wave,
without clearance, I instructed the F/O to initiate a turn 30 degrees right to avoid lower TCAS traffic ahead of us and to begin a descent to FL350. The turn was never completed as we flew into the area of severe turbulence. Auto throttles and autopilot both disengaged as the aircraft became uncontrollable. I took control of the throttles as the F/O struggled to maintain a wings level attitude and some sort of reasonable descent. I was finally able to [advise ATC], state we were leaving altitude, for severe turbulence. ATC cleared us to descend to FL290. At times during the event the aircraft was virtually uncontrollable with uncommanded bank angles reaching 30 degrees or greater, which the F/O stated he used full control deflection at times to return the wings to level attitude. Airspeed fluctuations of plus and minus 20 knots or greater were on going and at one time we experienced a brief stick shaker. The severe turbulence encounters continued frequently, becoming less frequent as we descended. The moderate to severe turbulence finally ended at about FL295 and was a much more comfortable moderate chop at FL290. ATC cleared us further down to FL 270 where the ride was reasonably comfortable but still choppy. We spent 2 to 3 minutes reengaging the automation and getting settled back on course. We then assessed the aircraft condition from the flight deck finding it to appear normal. A call was made to the F/A's checking if they were okay, enquiring about the condition of the aircraft and the passengers. I instructed the F/A's to walk through the cabin and check on the aircraft and our passengers. They reported back that the aircraft was a mess, but appeared structurally sound. None of the passengers were reported as injured, however several had become sick and vomited and concern was expressed for two pregnant passengers. We were over southeast Colorado and 800+ miles from our destination. I told the F/O I wanted to divert to ZZZ. He expressed valid concern about flying back into the vicinity of the turbulence. I felt we were below the worst of it and other aircraft were departing and landing at ZZZ. We informed ATC we wanted to divert to ZZZ. They cleared us direct. I called the F/A's on the interphone, once again and checked the condition of the passengers and aircraft. I informed them of our diversion; time to landing and my intention to have CFR meet the aircraft. I explained that I anticipated a normal landing, that we would stop the aircraft and have the rescue vehicles check it's condition prior to proceeding to the gate and that I would use the "remain seated" PA. I followed this briefing up with a similar briefing to the passengers. The QRH was consulted for severe turbulence encounters finding that the only checklist was applicable only during the actual event. The Electronic Engine Controls (EEC) had also disengaged and the QRH procedures only applied on the ground. A normal landing was made. We cleared on the high speed taxiway and stopped the aircraft. The "remain seated" PA was made. The CFR checked the aircraft visually finding no abnormalities. We taxied to the gate escorted by the CFR. During taxi ATC passed us a phone number to call after arrival. EMT's, fire personnel and many company staff met us at the gate. During post flight we completed our checklists and pulled the Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder circuit breakers. I than went to the main cabin to check on the condition Of the aircraft and passengers and meet the emergency personnel as they entered the aircraft. Log entries were made for a severe turbulence encounter, EEC trip off and pulling the breakers. This event occurred in clear air with little real warning. Frequency congestion contributed to our inability to request a timely descent, but we probably would have encountered severe turbulence even if we had descended to FL350 earlier. A working WSI system available in the aircraft would have been beneficial but would not necessarily have prevented the encounter. Provide a working WSI platform with an own ship position
indicator such as on the Jeppesen FD-Pro airport page. An enhanced system to send via dispatch or automatically updates to aircraft enroute. Callback: 1 After the event the reporter thought that the turbulence may have been beyond severe, but Maintenance found no discrepancies and released the aircraft for flight with a different crew. Narrative: 2 We were filed at 370 and that is the altitude we flew the flight. The flight was mostly smooth until approximately 170 miles southwest of ZZZ. We encountered a couple pockets Of light turbulence and the Captain asked ATC for ride reports ahead at lower altitudes. ATC advised us that there were reports at all altitudes of light, with some pockets of moderate chop, and some reports of light mountain wave. At that point the Captain asked the flight attendants to take their seats. At the onset of turbulence I immediately slowed the jet to .76 mach. The Captain and I agreed that the ride at 370 was just as good as a lower altitude. ATC informed us that east of ZZZ the rides improved to light chop. As we continued east the Captain and I were commenting about the wind changes. We had 100 knots on the tail, then 120 knots, it was up and down. There was nothing abnormal at this point in the flight. Just prior to the severe turbulence encounter, the windspeed began to decrease to 85 knots and was trending down. I also noticed that the direction of the wind was changing rapidly. The wind was shifting from westerly to southerly at approximately 60 knots when we encountered the severe turbulence. First, the autothrottles disconnected, followed by the autopilot disconnecting. I then took manual control of the jet. It became immediately apparent that the jet was becoming increasingly uncontrollable. At this point, I made a 30 degree turn to the right and began to descend. It was nearly impossible to do both keep the wings level and descend, so I was just trying to keep the jet from an upset position. The jet was violently rolling from left to right and I was using both aileron and rudder to keep the jet flying. I instructed the Captain to operate the thrust levers, as I needed both hands to try and control the jet. We continued to descend and from what I remember, gained full control of the jet around 30,000 feet. I estimate the event lasted approximately 5 minutes. Once out of the severe event, the Captain called the back to see if there were injuries, and at that point we knew the cabin crew was not injured. I slowed the jet down in the event we had any structural failure and we decided to divert to ZZZ to get the jet inspected and have the injured passengers receive medical attention. The Captain coordinated with the back and I flew the jet. We completed the severe turbulence checklist and we requested ARFF upon landing. We also informed the passengers that emergency vehicles would be present upon landing. I landed the jet, we taxied clear of runway and had the jet inspected for obvious damage. We asked to be followed to the gate as a precaution. Synopsis 8737 flight crew reported diverting after encountering a severe mountain wave over the Southern Rockies.

There was plenty of runway left and checking engine parameters I noticed the EPR readout on the EPR limit display was not steady and lower than it should be. I immediately pushed up the throttles to correct setting. Considering
airspeed, runway remaining and aircraft performance it was safe to continue and safer than rejecting the takeoff. Immediately after takeoff the R Engine Heat Valve amber light on the overhead panel began to cycle off and on very rapidly along with the EPR readout. After assuring the power was set properly I turned on the R Engine heat and all indications showed normal for Engine heat on. I then turned R Engine heat off and all indications were normal for the rest of the flight. All of us know that on the airplanes the Engine heat valve slowly cycling on and off in cruise IS almost a normal occurrence and is usually self- correcting before anything can be done, or performing the QRH procedure of cycling the switch has always corrected the problem. This is the first time in my experience it has happened other than cruise, and in my view on takeoff roll can be a very serious situation. I would hope that maintenance can solve this uncommanded engine heat valve problem. Synopsis A crew member in an MD-80 reported that takeoff roll seemed a little longer when he discovered #2 engine EPR was low.

We started engines normally, and obtained and checked our load closeout before we began the short taxi to runway XX. The wind, by this time, was only gusting to 34 kts and was pretty much straight down the runway. We ran the Before Takeoff Checklist normally with the trim set and verified at 4.4 units. The tower cleared us for takeoff and the First Officer advanced the thrust levers, as it was his leg. The takeoff proceeded normally until at about 120 kts (VI was around 150 kts) when we suddenly got a master warning and bell. I glanced down and saw that we had a configuration warning. I hesitated for beat and made the decision to abort the takeoff. The abort was normal and since I could see that we were decelerating quickly and would easily make our normal exit, I disengaged the RTO auto brake function to reduce from maximum to normal braking. We exited the runway and began to access the situation. I then saw that the configuration warning was for Stabilizer. I looked down and was astonished to see the trim was at 8 or 9 nose up units. I began to suspect a runaway trim, but we had no other warnings. We began a slow taxi back toward the terminal while the IRO consulted the cooling charts. We were good to proceed to the gate. During the taxi back, the first officer informed me that he might have been the cause for the
configuration warning. He was using a technique that he said had been pointed out to him by at least a couple of first officers. He said that he would trim nose up during the takeoff roll so that the rotation pressure would not be so heavy. Neither the IRO nor I had ever heard of this technique. Our brake cooling time was about an hour. We had maintenance come out and inspect the trim system and the brakes and everything was fine. He signed off the log and a couple of hours after the event, we departed. The First Officer trimmed the aircraft nose up during the takeoff roll so lighten the rotation force. He said that he had used this technique before. This time, however, he held the trim down and moved us out of the green band thus causing the configuration warning. I am very concerned about this technique and whether or not it is widespread. I have never noticed any of my FOs trimming during the takeoff run or heard of any such discussion, but this is a dangerous technique, for obvious reasons. I counseled the First Officer against using this technique in the future as it could lead to a tail strike or worse in addition to the configuration warning and abort. I believe my First Officer now fully understands the dangers of this technique. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Narrative: 3 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Synopsis 3757 flight crew reported the First Officer trimmed nose up during takeoff which caused a warning as trim exceeded the limit. The First Officer intended to lighten takeoff rotation effort, but was cautioned his action was poor technique.

Contributing Factors / Situations : Aircraft Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 Upon descent, the First Officer (pilot flying) extended the flight spoilers. Moments after extending the spoilers, the flight crew recognized the aircraft entered an uncommanded roll. This was followed by two caution messages: OUTBOARD (0B) SPOILERONS, 0B FLT SPOILERS. Captain handled QRH and determined to extend landing distance by 25% and land on longest runway. [Priority handling was requested], flight attendants briefed, passengers informed, dispatcher notified, and flight crew advised ATC to have emergency vehicles standing by. After a beautiful landing performed by the First Officer, the flight crew terminated the [priority with ATC] and continued to the assigned gate. Flight arrived at the planned gate without any injuries or aircraft damage. Maintenance was notified and they directed the Captain to perform a circuit breaker reset to fix a PCU jam. Once completed aircraft was returned back to service. Cause- 0B SPOILERONS, 0B FLT SPOILERS caution messages in flight. Suggestion- Properly maintain the spoiler PCLJs so they don't jam. Synopsis CRJ-900 Captain reported an outboard spoilers malfunction that caused an uncommanded roll, QRH procedures were followed and aircraft made a successful landing.

We checked in and were cleared to land 17R. I heard tower communicating with another aircraft that I could not hear. After recognizing a military call sign and became aware that they were on a HF frequency. Tower was advising him to remain in traffic for 17L as there was "traffic for 17R". A few seconds later he was advising them of traffic again for 17R and that it was a "Aircraft X". At this point I was trying to identify this aircraft as it was appearing to get a little out of hand between the tower controller and the military aircraft in the pattern. I identified the aircraft on TCAS as being at our 1130 to 12 o'clock and 300 feet below us climbing. At this point we are on final by the marker and we are trying to visually see the target. I look back at TCAS and the aircraft is 100 feet below us climbing and at 12 0'clock in close proximity. We receive a TCAS advisory to "descend. descend, descend now!" We visually see this [military aircraft] coming at us and climbing but then leveling off at our altitude. I followed the RA as best I could as it appeared to be all red descending. It immediately then transitioned to a climbing command as we were closer to the ground than what was comfortable for a high rate of descent. We were in a Flaps 23 gear down configuration at this point. We were able to level off. [Military aircraft] remained at our I to 2 0'clock position and was communicating with tower but we could only hear towers instruction to him. Tower appeared to try and get him into the pattern again for 17L. We configured for landing and were in the configuration by 1000 feet and I think we were stable. We were stable for sure at 500 feet. [Military aircraft] remained at the 1 to 2 o'clock position and I was too focused on him and what he may do as he was still too close to us after this incident to be comfortable. I wanted to go-around to collect our thoughts as this incident was way too close "for comfort" but I did not trust the actions of the [military aircraft] pilot after this incident as he was paralleling our course towards the runway and was trying to get back into the pattern so I felt it was safer to continue and land and we were descending on glide path to the runway and he was maintaining altitude upwind for the 17 runways. In summary we had a near miss on final approach to runway 17R in OKC which caused a TCAS RA. It commanded a uncomfortable descending RA within about 1500' of the ground followed by a climbing correction. We followed the RA as we were trained. I was the flying pilot and the autopilot was off. The [military aircraft] was close that the RA required me to
bring power to idle and push hard over to initiate the RA. At no time did the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) activate. We were stable on approach. We spoke with TRACON manager after landing and he advised that there were two military trainers in the pattern. There may have been some miscommunication between the aircraft and the tower controller. I made a PA at the gate advising the passengers of why the maneuvers on final and also the Flight Attendant heard very clearly the oral warnings as did some first class passengers. Appeared the military trainer entered final for our runway of 17R instead of 17 L and when instructed to go around or re-enter the pattern he turned directly into our flight path and came directly at us. Narrative: 2 [Report narrative contained no additional information.] Synopsis Air Carrier Captain on approach to OKC reported a NMAC with a military aircraft.

Contributing Factors / Situations : Contributing Factors / Situations : Primary Problem : Aircraft Narrative: 1 Human Factors Aircraft During [the] flight to ZZZ I calculated fuel and decided the aircraft would be easier to hand fly at 16000 feet instead Of FL260. The ride was forecasted rough there by ATC so I opted to stay at 16000 feet as I showed landing fuel of 3400 LBS and was ACARS messaged "What possible scenario could make you fly at 16000 feet instead of FL 260 as filed". I found that very aggressive and questioning of my judgment and after the event on the previous flight and the strenuous [maintenance] delay I decided my mind had reached its max for the day from [an early] wake up and found the bad questioning and wording to frustrate me, and me airing on the side of safety to be unprofessional and I took myself off line. Keep in mind the First Officer (FO) nor Flight Attendants felt comfortable going but I assured their safety and completed the flight. After having a pitch trim runaway on [a previous] flight on short final with little elevator authority and zero left aileron authority I made a quick sound decision to land the aircraft with the assistance of the FO. Once on touch down we had zero ground dump spoilers and the controls were stuck in the full left deflection all the way to the gate until hydraulic pumps were turned off. No question a major fault in the system which was diagnosed to be the autopilot which then they MELed. This resulted in a fatigue call. Synopsis CRJ-700 Captain reported flying at a lower than filed altitude due to a previous maintenance issue with the aircraft.

I executed a direct to in the FMS and then selected 19,000 feet. It was at that time that the aircraft began to feel like it was skidding. The Captain made the comment that the aircraft felt like something was wrong and it felt like we were losing an engine. We checked all the engine gauges and all were with in normal limits. We then looked at the inclinometer and found that the aircraft had full left ball. It was at the time [I] initiated rudder hard over immediate action items. Very shortly after pressing and holding the quick disconnect button we received master warning EICAS messages of dual pitch trim failures. The Captain made the decision to return to [departure airport]. We [advised ATC], and it was at that point we made a descent to 11,000 feet and requested vectors. I was purely focused on controlling the airplane because it was continually wanting to go in to a cross-controlled condition. The aircraft required heavy left rudder input. The Captain ran the QRH for the pitch trim failures first, [and] he was able to get them back. Once that problem was fixed we ran the QRH for the rudder hard over and we kept that system off because they were not working properly after running the procedure. We then notified the Flight Attendant. We informed her we would be touching down in 15 min and that there would not be an evacuation. We then set up for approach. There was a slight crosswind but we elected to land on [the] largest runway, we also elected to land flaps 22 so that we could keep the speed up to maintain more rudder authority. We were able to land the aircraft safely and taxi the aircraft to the gate. The threats we had to deal with were two simultaneous failures, one of which (the rudder) did not present in an obvious manner. The only error that we as a crew made was we did not brief how were going to transfer controls after landing or how we would react if we lost control on the ground. I feel that the crew as a whole acted to near perfection in this situation. We took our time handling the problems. I focused solely on flying the airplane while the Captain worked on the checklist and communications. We worked through the problems efficiently and were able to land the aircraft safely. Synopsis EMB-145LR First Officer reported returning to departure airport after experiencing issues with the rudder and stabilizer trim.
